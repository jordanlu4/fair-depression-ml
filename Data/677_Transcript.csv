I'm going to bring up over to Human
 you can't
 hi I'm Ellie
 I'm not a therapist but I'm here
 and please
 yes
 I'm doing fine and yourself
 where are you from originally
 I was born in
 gone for so long I've been down to Georgia for a while but my family is all it from here so that's why I'm here
 the rudeness of the people
 I see what you mean
 do you travel a lot been all over the world
 driving a funny car down a drag strip and 200 miles an hour
 what you study
 basic automotive stuff and I worked at the drag strip already go to school so I got to know quite a few people
 what are you doing now
 right now I'm on workman's comp I work for Amvets and I got hurt at work and I'm on workman's comp right now
 okay
 what's your dream job
 I really don't have one at this time
 pretty much outgoing
 I'm able to talk to anybody had any time no matter what race they are just
 I'm one of them lucky persons that can talk to anybody
 I'll let them do their own thing I just lost my wife three years ago today in Georgia so that's why I came back here I had nobody else left in Georgia
 sometimes what I'm feeling.
 I turn on the fan
 screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got
 I go fishing play cars at the little casinos around here
 that's what I do to relax
 my temper is fine I don't get mad very often
 when was the last time
 probably a bad poker hand
 can you tell me about that
 yeah and I was trying to cheat me and I caught him
 so that was pretty much it
 tell me about a situation that
 with my wife she died from liver shut down due to alcohol and she was 7 year breast cancer survivor but
 the alcohol liver killed her and I could have done that little bit differently but that's that's hindsight
 what's something you feel guilty about
 I'm just trying to get her some help but she didn't want no help so I could have got her help I would have been had it turned out she didn't want no help
 tell me about the hardest decisions
 turn off the machine she lived on machines so I had to turn them off and what's your died from you
 tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your
 doing CPR on her in the hospital room living on machines and stuff that's not living
 have you ever serve
 yes I have
 have the firemen in the United States Air Force for 6 years
 how have you been feeling lately
 I last couple days been rough
 other than that I got a torn rotator cuff in my shoulder and trying to get that fixed and
 I'm working like I said I'm on workman's comp right now so I'm hopefully they get it fixed
 not really
 I don't sleep very well at all I got lots of pain in my arm
 just my my arm getting the right position to sleep a little bit but you move a little bit and you got a lot of pain in your arm
 sleeping in my sleep for 1 hour
 but that been in that pattern for quite some time
 the same way I fight my sleep well
 you got to get what kind of slavery in your body's resting but your your mind is thinking all the time so
 no
 maybe I should have been no
 a long time ago but I got over it
 20 years ago
 I'm feeling helplessness just couldn't get out of a hole when you get into a whole has no light at the end of the tunnel and
 eventually comes through
 not really I just you dig yourself into a hole and hard hole to climb out of it and eventually it will
 I love my wife Diane and stuff and maybe I was feeling sorry for myself at the time but
 I just
 got the whole one had to dig myself out I knew it had to get better someday soon
 one day at a time
 she was always on my mind every single day
 think of what I could have done for her but there was nothing I could do for
 what continent is the cow
 just need a little bit of help to get out of the rut that I'm in and I'm getting out of it now so
 things are looking up on the bright side
 do you still got
 I know
 why did you stop
 they were telling me the wrong thing I didn't want to hear she's not a witch
 they said the grieving.
 Was two or three months seen on had I still think of my dad he died 10 years ago you know I said who who said that I'd be grieving very last that long and they told me to book says that and I said you take your book and shove it
 cuz some people some people have to grieve longer than others
 just the way it is
 do you feel therapy is useful
 no I don't think so I think you have to deal with your own problems
 if people all people have different problems in my snow
 just getting over it
 how about getting over the loss of the last 10 years my
 my dad my older sister and my older brother my mother and then my wife in the last 10 years it's been tough
 It's been real tough on me
 I got sick a few times end up in the hospital
 I don't go to therapy anymore I can kind of pretty much do it on my own
 okay
 when was the last time
 I feel happy all the time
 oh yeah I'm always been a happy happy go lucky kind of guy hanging on but talk to my friends all over the country you know and it said you sound good and that is why I'm good and just you know I got stuck in this rotten pulling myself out and it's just the way it is
 a positive influence has been done just do it on my own
 how'd your best friend
 I seem all time
 they just
 go along with the flow just like I go along the floor with them they might do stuff I don't appreciate but that's their own life
 I'm going on a fishing trip last week out notion
 had a pretty good time out there and then midnight go to the drag races see all my friends from all over the country
 some
 good to see them they're glad to see me so
 have a good time
 what are you most proud
 let's see
 getting away from drugs and alcohol I was pretty proud of myself I had to do what I had to do and
 just leave the situation and go to new situation
 thank you
 goodbye have a good day
