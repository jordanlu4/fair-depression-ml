 ask questions you can answer Ray

 glitch glitch
 like a computer glitch or something
 okay
 yep yes
 okay
 pretty good pretty good I had a good morning a good productive day did some work with the some kids at a basketball camp so
 New York
 well
 what I like about
 what do I know about traveling
 meeting new people kind of having that experience of
 being in the moment all the time because everything is so new
 and
 just kind of getting my
 my routine shaken up a little bit temporarily
 my trips are probably
 that's one baby was when I went to Costa Rica
 if I got like seven or eight other friends and then
 four of us went on to go to Guatemala and I'm sorry
 Panama to an island off Panama and You're Just Amazing Just total New World new totally new cultures off the beaten path it was nothing I never seen before so
 open up my eyes to
 the world lolbit
 probably
 I studied
 theater and politics and music
 right now I am deciding or figuring out if I'm going to be
 doing basketball as a career or if I'm going to be doing it networking type stuff as a career
 kind of depends probably
 probably 65% sure I'm 35% alcohol
 I
 and I think I just like to kind of take
 take things slow and get to know someone a little bit first before I open up to them but sometimes I'm just in a real gregarious mood it just kind of floats out of me and I'm just like talking everyone but usually I kind of hang back a little bit and
 get a feel for the person before I open up to them
 all meditate now it's been so helpful
 play Hoops I write a. Journal
 and I talked to someone that and I care about let him know that I love him
 probably too good
 I think I keep
 things inside maybe sometimes I'm free pretty patient I kind of
 put it all on my shoulders and
 well ya know once or twice
 things built up and I didn't Express them
 so it eventually led to like erratic Behavior because it kind of came out in like spurts are like bursts
 and a bunch of stuff is like Unleashed it once
 instead of you know normally something happens it gets released when this case
 something got released it was like a hundred things got released at 1 cuz it all been saved up
 the last time I argue with someone
 probably with
 when I
 broke up with my girlfriend before I
 was
 deployed overseas
 yeah I didn't
 back the way I handle that
 I kind of just laughed and pretending not to care anymore
 she didn't deserve that her family didn't deserve that
 it's been pretty good to me
 starcycle erase
 yes
 18
 because I am I want to serve my country I was born in New York and New York was hit the timer 11th and I was 17
 and I
 do I want to go to college so why not
 termite country
 yes all in all yes it was tough it was tough but
 and you are
 I needed to get that dose of reality
 kind of a pretty drastic change from make a wish there had been more of a gradual increase in the intensity of experience
 I got a little overwhelmed at times but
 Made Me Stronger in the end
 yes
 Acme
 you know that's a lie like a few maybe 5 or 7 years to completely kind of a simile my experience but only like me in the first 6 months after
 I got out of the army was a little strained I kind of just
 did nothing cuz I don't even so structure for so long and I was just like
 I'm living on my own schedule not doing anything yeah and then
 you know I was coming sometime after that just to kind of figure out what I wanted to do in life
 I went back to school or went went went to college for the first time started playing basketball game for college and
 if we kept that up last couple years I just started
 coaching basketball in
 doing some computer training learning networks do networking
 and it's right now I'm right now I'm writing a book on
 what I've learned
 Aurora
 really good really
 really free like I'm creating my own future now for the first time
 and a long long time
 yeah yeah
 it's been a little bit
 what's the word like I knew on the edge
 no not not like
 since
 I'm the biggest thing I change my behavior was signed to meditate
 for sure so did that for the first time by 3 years ago
 and
 that
 the pretty much brought me back to myself I kind of like you know what I consider to be like my true self
 so that doesn't change my behavior has now I'm acting more from
 my heart instead of like reacting to like my thoughts about to pass the future
 nine times Outta ten
 Ashley pretty great
 when I don't sleep well it's pretty clear I'm pretty I'm pretty quiet I kind of keep to myself
 I don't have that like sparkle I don't have that like
 valakut attack energy know that energy to go out and get go out and get it right now
 little bit tired didn't sleep that great last night
 so they went to bed late and I'm going to go to bed like 9:10 last night I went to bed at like 1 and I'm helping a friend move
 so yeah today I'm feeling I'm a little bit like black
 no
 not really
 no I never been diagnosed I went to a. Where
 you know the first two or three years after I was in the Army and I kind of wanted life to be the way it was before I joined the army things I think there wasn't a lot simpler than to me and a lot more manageable and then I got hurt while playing basketball
 and you know so I couldn't like play Hoops for a while for like 2 years and I'd say like I was pretty. I was pretty down during that.
 But
 I was thinking as I was always
 I had one foot in the down the down Zone but my other foot was in like how do I get myself out of this predicament I never liked gave up hope
 flashes like fossil flash like
 every everyone long once in awhile recite what's the point you know like and then just died at the end anyways so why so why fight you know why struggle
 but
 in general live 99.999% of the time
 got it got it just going to go deep inside and find out what the right thing to do is and then do it the best I can
 well I was I mean
 I was pretty happy last night when I saw my girlfriend and I got to like spend quality time with her and just kind of like give her love and like not make it all about swing physical and I was pretty happy when I first got into La so we could go and I made it to Venice and I was playing hoops and sunny as beautiful and I was free at my car
 hey No Agenda at Money in the Bank
 probably
 I know by when I went on that trip to
 well
 person Moments 2 years ago me and my brother and my sister went on a trip together Dominican Republic

 definitely definitely of the girl that was my
 my first love like she was a great person
 to really really good heart
 and
 I kind of
 my best friend probably thinks that like you know I'm
 Miss like funny cool guy
 that's like going to be a movie star someday or something

 just like make everything fun for everyone else
 playing basketball in Venice Beach
 smite
 to my it's either my phone or I may just be the first to tie for first
 place to pay to play basketball in the hole that I ever played
 and now is
 play yesterday against a bunch of guys
 and it was just great it was just magical it's I love I love to be I love the people I love the the craziness that comes through their people on bikes with boom boxes be inclined to the people freaking just stuff in the background on the boardwalk
 you know running around make things interesting
 and I'm playing basketball I missed all of that and just
 that's great
