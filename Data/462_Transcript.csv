alright wonderful
 okay thanks
 yeah
 I'm okay
 I'm from Los Angeles
 oh the weather the weather the weather the weather the beach the weather the beach the laid-back miss the driving instead of public transportation
 and a sporty
 I really I don't know the lack of I don't know there's not a lot I don't like about Olay it's compared to most cities I really it's my favorite and I've lived around the world I love it I love La a lot
 I'm sure you can tell by me
 yes I've lived in Paris and I've been around the world a lot
 it's just dumb it's fun and it's it's it's it's it's a blast it's good to see new places it's good to get to get to experience all the
 fantastic I'm sites and in in cultures
 well I mean I I I tended to actually do a lot of them I probably would do them differently I think I'm more developed as a person now I lived in Paris for two years so and I lived in Spain for Spain was fun Spain Madrid is a party town and then and then to these were all work they were all work so that was working so it was on his grind and you didn't really appreciate you know what was around you so much and then I mean I still I still love going just to you know vacation spots like a Y A N Dent Tamika I'm still just really a sucker for that kind of stuff
 I guess Madagascar was pretty much like just really bitching because it was it was in the eighties and it was like you were seeing a lot of people that have never seen white people before according to the guy driving us around I might he might have been lying but it was just it was bitching and Africa was pretty much the best Senegal and Madagascar
 I'm right now about to go for an early childhood education degree and then I did a little bit of a paralegal but that was really just to just to get the just to get the Skype and I didn't really have any concept of what I want to do now I really do
 I have I was saying to Rachel actually I don't know if you guys are able to overhear I really think that the way the school system goes right now is it just it it turns people into into I'm just a just a doggy dog. You know I don't like the way I think it's told draining the school system right now and I feel pretty bad for everybody so I want to try to fix that
 that would be my dream job that's so I'm excited like I want to go in a direction that I want to go and yeah that would be my dream job is to work with sort of getting kids on it more organic Universal you know trajectory
 I think it could be done I don't think it would be done via any sort of legislation except here and there I mean that always ends up becoming you know facade in Farsi itself anyway but I think there are ways I've always reached kids anyway and I've always felt where I was coming from and so I think you know there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to the system
 I guess I'm just a combination of the two I don't think
 I don't know actually I'm kind of might even be working that out there might be some outgoingness to overcompensate for what's actually shyness and vice versa.
 Yeah that's cool
 I definitely try to reflect and stay in a pretty Lucid space is often as possible so
 a lot of lying down at the moment I'm in transition so there's just a lot of and I hang out with my dog's a lot so that's quite soothing why I try not to do I don't really do anything that's to can't unless it's time for like time to drive to a job or time to you know go make some things happen meetings and stuff but otherwise I try to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time so it's not like breaking but you know and I meant I'm assuming I can't believe summer is coming so I'm going to swim some more to
 when I'm truly outraged it comes out and then I I'm I'm I'm hitting some kind of bad part right next time I'm fighting for my child so there are times when I will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam
 a little bit but usually pretty much there's always you know someone in the periphery that gets it and and you know it's like that bumper sticker If you're not outraged you're not paying attention so usually some kind of Sanity can prevail
 oh well I mean these are also times where I just can't find something in the car and a bit when I argue with people it's been a lot of the times when I'm being flat out you know sabotage drawer definitely when
 you know I lost my temper dreadfully with unfortunately the woman that gave me birth because that she is intrinsic and a lot of I mean she's pretty much horrible person so I recently lost my temper with her
 I felt like
 I mean I I like again I think I should have said this just now I felt in a way good because I get it you know which is as opposed to not getting it which is even worse but I guess there's another side of the bank of the thing to get to to where you can be a little more constructive about it it's like you know you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a horrible travesty going on but then you have to figure out how to deal with a horrible try to stay
 but so I mean I didn't feel like shame I really honestly didn't feel shame I didn't I didn't feel there times when I feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because there are people that will try to use that against you that's all but I never really feel bad for being angry about what I'm angry about
 well when I was pregnant I wish I had
 like I said I went through such an Awakening about realizing when I was being sort of undermined that that demanding my respect became a huge issue and when I was pregnant I ended up being so disrespected in the place cuz I was being a hippie on the beach for 6 years so I was it felt like I was being so disrespected in the place where I was set to be when the child arrived at I stormed out via what was a good survival mode before but left me jumping out of the frying pan Into the Fire and they got my kid so
 yeah
 it's fucked up
 I don't want to erase anything from my memory I like having everything Consolidated and cohesive I don't and integrated I don't want to erase anything from my memory
 well did I get it right or did I get it wrong I guess the hardest decision was whether or not to sign sign mediation agreement with DCFS in and I should have said no let's just go straight to court because that there is nothing wrong with me I just happened to succumb to an SSI check via bulshit with my mother's and I should have just been you know brave enough to just go in there and do that and instead I chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out
 over consciousness
 it's horrific horrendous Borgia quality Intrigue and sabotaged it's bad
 that's okay
 someone that I mean
 there's been
 you know there's been some
 some great people that again from a far I have not sort of really achieved a real great ability to build relationships and I'm working through that great writing it right now and I think that's a lot why don't I have my son but as I've grown in developed I have seen encouragement from like-minded souls and you can see that and say that's wonderful and but otherwise you know a constant you know contact with someone that's really good for me it has been hard for me to get to that point
 how is your day
 not so easy if he says it all
 I'm being I've been I'm not completely centered and then there's been some actual you know people thinking it's funny to harass me or jolt me as they walked by and so there's been actual harassment and stuff like that
 I'm still pretty Pollyanna doubt I still look forward to head and try to be as pleasant as possible
 I'm tired and drained and a little bit frustrated because that I know that I've been sort of that I sort of have a bit of my energy and and space being usurped and I can tell and I don't know how to get through that and passed it
 no
 no
 there are I'm basically a very very very happy pretty much list out person but this fighting for my son has me sort of trudging areas that it is it the same trees that were thrown in my Road in childhood before I realize I was such a happy person or thrown there again so I'm going through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes but you know during the day I'll I'll think something completely true and organic and I'll just stare at something to wow that's beautiful and I'll be reminded pretty close to my spirit so I try to stay there 24/7 I'm pretty spiritual that way
 I mean if I had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me gets pretty competitive out there that you know that I'm this is off you guys
 that I'm funny and that and that
 I think that's bad I'm done funny and that I'm good and that that I'm trustworthy
 Legacy West
 just not necessarily change but grow through my ability to connect with the people I want to connect with
 and disconnect from the people that manage to to drain me
 I already said I regret the thing with them leaving the place where I could have delivered my son even though I was being abused
 get the fuck away from your mother
 you know and like a lot of
 and and yeah and two open your eyes look what look what's going on
 I'm proud of my spirit and my Outlook and my my access to what's really going on in the world and my awakeness I'm just proud of me as a person
 okay
 you're welcome
 bye
 it's okay it's the old thing yeah it's the old test the other one likes heard of two questions ago
