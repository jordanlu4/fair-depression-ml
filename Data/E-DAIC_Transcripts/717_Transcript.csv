 no I used to I used to be a truck driver but now I'm a student at La Trade Tech so I'm home base now
 what do you enjoy about
 Siri meeting different people
 I'd like to hear
 an experience when I went to North Carolina being there for the weekend the atmosphere was great so different beats type lifestyle imagine where to put it up
 the party life is different
 there's a lot of clubs over there so I mean I really had a night time during the weekend that I was there made a lot of nice people got laid
 did you have a good memory
 my most memorable experience
 I really don't know which one to pick out for you I've been a lot of places and done a lot of things and a lot of time as far as me having asthma I have an attack it's a lot of things that I do forget but overall my past has been very good
 diesel technology and learn how to do how to be a repair technician for like the buses diesel trucks anything is running out diesel they've taught me how to repair engines take them apart and put back together troubleshooting electrical work I'm really enjoying it because I like doing things with my hands and the thing is that they're teaching me I can use it for the rest of my life and I really is something that I can probably pass on the others so you know I really like it
 what do you do now
 all right now leave the time I ride my bike a lot going to do some parts of LA a lot of time to go to the beach I like Venice and Santa Monica Beach a lot
 just Ashley just seeing this country and not the country but the city has a lot of places I haven't been I don't have a driver's license but just being able to ride my bike and go over the freedom to go where I want to I really love that
 all right
 what's your dream job
 my dream job
 motorcycle racing riding a motorcycle Superbike racing that's my dream job
 me and my family with distant I'm in touch with my dad but as far as cousins and my mom we don't talk
 sometimes when I'm feeling
 what is the fastest guy
 what do you do
 smoke some weed and go to sleep
 my zodiac sign is a Taurus so
 it takes a lot to make me angry but if it's something that I know is someone that done something wrong I just simply try to tell them about it to correct them but being physical I tried not to get into that but you know you got people out there to really don't care about your feelings so sometimes I ain't walking away not dealing with him anymore
 when was the
 I'm going through a divorce I just experienced a domestic violence incident where me and her got nervous about who's going to clean the house so I took it upon myself to I punched in the shoulder and call the police on myself if I'm two days in jail I can order the home has been since January or right now I'm working on my divorce
 I wish the best for her and the family meeting is no hard feelings about it you know
 and at home if they have an apartment now on they're doing good but I feel that she should have been more friendly about the way we broke up because she changed the locks on the apartment and I didn't get a chance to get any of my like my tools and put paperwork birth certificate and whatnot she still has that but you know I feel like they to pick my life up and continue on you know I don't wish nothing bad about her hopefully she's happy I know that she's with the baby's daddy's come from Louisiana he's staying with her now and you know it is
 how would I put it I'm not mad about it I'm more hurt the hurt feeling this what it is
 I just did I wouldn't have got physical with her I felt it there was going this way so I called myself being away from the home a lot and she kind of noticed it but yeah he got me the convinced that you know me being a husband or you know a father figure that I'm supposed to be spending more time with the family so they can I change my perspective but when I done that my daddy call it putting all my ducks in the basket where she's got my social security number you know my information everything I just open myself up to her which have fell today you know it was a waste of time is a bad move but you know
 Life Goes On
 you feeling
 I mean guilt come from doing stuff that you know you shouldn't have done
 oh I don't do that in life I don't steal I mean live by the Bible so guilt I don't have that
 Harley decision
 I just made the decision that actually out of a reaction in a sense it's not hard for me to make a decision that's not like me
 tell me about Nevada
 dealing with women their best of the wrong women
 I know it in the future that you know women are different that the ones who have done such is that individual is not an all-woman type thing but
 right now in my life I just need the right one
 I don't like being by myself I felt that me being married would alleviate that but I married the wrong one evidently hopefully that if I decide to take that step again that it be the right one this time because you don't you know you're getting old and time than went by and you can't bring that back
 yes I'm a veteran
 okay
 how have you been feeling lately
 how I feel
 I never thought about it but me I feel good I mean I'm healthy I'm just glad you know you my freedom maybe in Black you really think about the fact of your other race being locked up a lot of history and I feel that me I'm doing good
 so you know to me I'm happy about life
 my association with women is different
 I don't like whole conversation with women that don't know like I used to it's hard for me to like how you say start a relationship or friendship rather with a female now when it comes to men I'm not gay and I don't do gay things so we don't get that out of the way but as far as me and you know I don't have friends but when it comes to being advice you know I experienced that a lot of God few students classmates rather that kind of like leaning toward me when it comes to how would you say me helping them and I kind of like get in trouble for that so I guess you would say of me being outgoing I rather think about other people more than myself
 my dad told me it's time for me to start thinking about me so I'm trying to get my mind into that frame where you know I'm just concentrating on better in life for myself now
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 find out what I had due to doing the day is no problem but I sometimes worry about the next day in about you know what's going to happen or how I'm going to handle it
 I thought you know you sometimes get the dreaming about how thing is going to be in if it goes to the world
 you know the dream leads to Didion or a bad situation you'll wake up from it it's not considered a nightmare but my body I wake up
 and I don't sleep well I not doing today I mean I'm not irritable
 emotionally unstable but I don't have problems sleeping if I sit too long in one spot and I know that I'm going to be there for more than 30 minutes I can go to sleep it's no problem for me
 have you ever been diagnosed with
 no
 have you been diagnosed
 no no depression
 when was the last time
 when men the ex-wife in a kids wear at the beach
 we was all having a good time
 positive influence
 I really can't think of any way to slow down a floor that would be my daddy I mean you know he's made it to life and then made a lot of good things for people where you can sit back now and not really worried about things you know he just taking his last few days once you know one day at a time in a sense he really concerned about how I'm doing because the time of the seasons I made you know when it gets to the point where I ran into a problem I'll call him and give me advice about it and sometimes I don't do what he asked me to do or tell me to do it make you mad you know
 you know especially like when it comes to female so I will say my dad
 my best friend my best friend I'll be there
 I guess
 nice wait slow down
 it's hard to think of that kind of stuff
 I really don't pay attention to it
 I'm most proud of
 but I still have the desire to continue I'm proud of that I mean life's been good
 okay
 goodbye to YouTube
