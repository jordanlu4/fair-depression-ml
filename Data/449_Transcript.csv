thank you
 hi
 okay
 yes I am
 I'm good thank you
 originally from Los Angeles and my parents are from Central America
 yes
 the weather I like that I can get to the water if I want to go to the hills or hike or just any element that want to get to I can get you
 traffic busyness everybody's always in a hurry that's about it
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer
 you travel a lot when I can I have family in Central America and when I can my husband and I we try to go to warm places like Mexico or somewhere in the Caribbean
 the freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something I said I would do if I'm at home and if I'm too far away from home to do it then I don't have anything to worry about
 recently I went to Honduras again that's where my family is from so sore like a it's a dual fault I get to see my family but also kind of get to be away from home so I do it by not imposing on them I visit them but I stay in a hotel so that way I can still kind of have my freedom and not feel like I'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way
 experiences on vacation or
 experience probably Hawaii in Lahaina and just having enough food I'm a foodie so having the pig roast it on the ground and just eating it that way it's just I've never been able to taste it that way anytime else so it's like a very memory is a deep memory for me cuz no matter what I do to my porchetta never taste like that pork in Lahaina
 business and that was years ago so I ended up in the marketing field so I've enjoyed I'd my business background did help me in the marketing field
 my dream job
 well I guess it would have to do with food I love to cook and only reason I hesitated because I love to cook but I just do it for home and friends and family if I were to turn into in if it would have turned into a job I feel as if it was just not be as joyous or I wouldn't have as much fun as I do have it you know what I have now but if I could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that I have in cooking everyday now then that would be my dream job
 I'm not going
 depends on where I'm at if I'm wherever I'm at actually the first thing to do is just going to get a hold of myself that way I'm always in control no matter where I'm standing at and always say that I am my own piece p a p e a c e so I just kind of just take a deep breath assess my situation figure out what I can control what I can't control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kind of
 breathing get a hold of myself first
 I'm actually very good I'm actually very mild temper to begin with I don't really let anything agitate me and so if I do feel myself is getting hot or if I just react I just told her just like I said just do my own little self check you know I'm not a customer went off for a second but I do my own little self check and just so you know what come on now it's not worth it this person is not worth it the situation is not worth it be who you are and just stay there
 introducing my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and I was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kind of overlooking my feelings in it and I was I didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if I wasn't feeling the way I was feeling so I kept stressing my point in different ways and I found myself now in a debate and then that's when I pull back and said not look babe this is how I feel about it I'm not asking you to make me feel any differently I'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings
 when I got to my own conclusion I felt triumphant because the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how I felt not for him to impose his you know he's very Macho kind of manly guy I don't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic and so I said no as long as I have felt better because I eat I feel understood and I felt heard
 I get my son comes to mind he's 22 years old and he we have a very strange relationship right now and it's okay I'm okay with it is used to be be a little bit more needy so he I think he assumed that I would just always look cook go looking for him or call for him as opposed to waiting for him to call me and I think I may be a very weird answer but I wish early on in my life as his mother I would have kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know I'll try to make sure that he's okay I think it's probably way more than you met but I would have thought would have done that different I would have mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that I would have treated him more of an adult and then also not expected him to just kind of you know
 I would have to kill the expectation in him for me to Contour see him if that makes sense
 I know it's not easy you have to sacrifice and Beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kids needs ahead of your own and I guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so my son and my daughter they both know I love them unconditionally so my parents and has become easier the more and more I've lived in that true for I'm not expecting anything from them but then I also not expecting any disrespect so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect
 seeing them maybe make decisions that I wish they wouldn't make it could be as simple as an outfit no choice or as much as a career change but having to sit back and watch them listen to be open and then just kind of just be there in only want to talk about it but then not also also try not to manage them because I was also their age and have to remember that I didn't want to be managed and even if I made a mistake I don't want to be judged so the difficult part is watching them go through the process on their own and just sort of kind of just waiting around and luckily something major with my kids but whatever that personal downfall is just kind of being there and not having an I told you I told you so Spirit on me
 Shuffle feeling knowing that you know I created this and all I plan both my kids so it's just it's a real it's an honor that I was able to do it as an honor that they're healthy and it's fun watching them so just kind of grow into their own and it's like they're minimis but then they're all so different than I am and so it's fun just being able to allow them be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so I'm enjoying that
 wow completely my parents immigrated here from Central America in the 60s I was born the year after they got here so they're their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the American lifestyle and which was not a bad thing is it that their parenting style was more about making sure we had a home making sure we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter so I had to kind of figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had
 divorcing my first husband cuz I was going to be the one that toppled that whole situation he was a good father just not a good husband to me and after 20 years I knew that I was going to be the one to say this is not working for me anymore and since I did that the domino effect was is this is not virtual it happened we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while and then I just made some decisions to where I didn't want to go through so much Court hassle so I just did a Tina Turner and said just give you my name you keep everything else so it was a very hard decision by way of how it affected my kids that's all I cared about in terms of losing everything physical and and all the material stuff I could care less but it was hard because I I knew it was going to affect my kids and they were the only thing I was concerned about
 my husband and I did not you know see eye-to-eye on certain things United regarding our marriage heat I didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who I am and those are the very areas that he didn't validate me and he just kind of saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extra-curricular is where there was his travel or or whatever the case maybe I'm not I'm not here to talk about that part of it bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home and I was tired of just you know working and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change the despite all the counseling went through and I thought well this is not working for me and I have to take care of myself first and I had low self-esteem I mean I wasn't perfect I had a lot of things going on with myself and I had to learn how to love myself and I were to die in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the dog that I should get in return
 how is your day
 you know what is actually pretty easy because of the end of the day I just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes I'm happy that day or whatever great thing went on that day my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when I put my head down at night I just ask myself didn't you know that I do anything but I'm ashamed of today that I cross anybody that I not do you know and I'm not being a Pollyanna but I believe in karma I'm a God-fearing woman so I just want to make sure that I did everything I'm supposed to do today and if there's something I can Rectify it you know I just make it a point to promise to myself to go back and rectified or at least learn from that and just not make the same mistake in another day
 really good light you don't have to rough patches with the family individually like I said with my son my daughter the teenagers so she's kind of coming into her own so that's a different relationship to the opposite of me I'm actually very easy going very Bohemian style she's very social very it'll just out there so I'm having to just kind of find our balance but overall it's just I won't complain I'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle that I just kind of foster on my own every day and I just enjoy my little mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not
 no I haven't thanked God
 no
 really happy to see
 that's at home and I think it was when
 different things running through my head
 I think with my daughter and I my teenage daughter and I came to understand understanding on our mother daughter relationship I'm not trying to be her best friend but yet doesn't mean you can't talk to me and I think when she came to me the other day just going to give me a big hug from behind me without really saying anything I really felt her just accepting herself and she accepted the fact that I accept who she is as she is so it was a very same moment I only see and I kind of knew about it but it just gave me just a happiness it nothing else could ever give me
 thank you
 I'm easy going I'm fine I'm just very you know a chameleon comes to mind I just kind of acclimate to It Whatever situation I'm in I'm very honest I'm very real and just you know old if I have to be I'm just very adult I'm an adult woman and you know they were just described my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable I do as I say I say what I do and I just you know I don't I don't deal with BF
 how to change about myself probably cosmetic things maybe I would just sounds weird that I was saying nothing nothing really
 I think I would just be a little bit more aware of others I think I'm super sensitive to others but I think I would just be more aware make sure that I'm not being selfish or I'm not turning anyone out just because I want to get through my yoga I want to do something else I think I would just be more observant and aware of those around me to make sure I'm not offending anybody
 I don't have any regrets that I think about that all the time and you know this is natural to go back and say if I were in that situation with the mindset I have now what would I do it but the reality is that I know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me so I can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret because I know I learned from it probably sounds very textbook but that's true that's is really how I live so I believe that everything good bad ugly or indifferent happen for a reason I truly believe that and my job is to take from it what I'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future so I'm to take the you know the Hard Knocks with it with the joys
 be real with myself that's that's one thing that took me 20 years to kind of get to just to kind of be honest with myself to embrace who I am to just you don't get to know who I am learn my own infrastructure be comfortable with the with the innate things that are a part of me don't try to read. I read that myself or try to become something that I'm not I would have still chosen the same marketing career to see if I would have still climb the same corporate ladders but I would have done it from a more internal place not that I lost myself in it but when in terms of my family life I would have just been more true to myself and that way I would have had any kind of resentments
 my family my my role as a wife my role as a mother I think that ultimately that's where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what at the end of this life this life of in this body and this vehicle. I mean I'm going to do or I'm going to be as an Epitaph and somewhere in a cemetery
 and I'm always just true to that I mean I've been always true to that from the time I Was Eighteen and realize I wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that I think that ultimately that that's where my true fulfillment comes from
 thank you
 bye
 that's cool that's cool
 okie dokie
