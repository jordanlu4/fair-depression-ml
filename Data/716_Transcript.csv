not very typical to that happen but just in case I kind of have to give you a warning so that you don't sit in here can I go in what's going on so it fits yeah I'd say 30 seconds or more
 for real
 I'm going to go ahead and start her up okay
 I'm not a therapist
 and please
 okay
 how are you doing today all right
 Inland Empire

 man to do with military
 but none recently
 I don't think I have one not anymore
 I guess going overseas
 studying solar panel technology in currently studying right now
 student
 on my own business and what I don't know yet
 but something looking for myself
 you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
 both
 it's not good right now I don't really talk to him
 certain situations came up I don't really talk to him
 sometimes when I'm feeling 10
 I know it's not Hawaii
 gym I go to the gym let us tension
 stress anything that I can possibly do one thing I know going to the gym
 the only thing I really got right now that relieves anything that I have
 not sure
 I can control it at times
 sometimes it'll get out of control
 my girlfriend we are getting pretty good. It was about why I don't call her enough and when I wasn't calling her enough
 you got pretty bad
 there's a lot of them
 what's something you feel guilty about
 guilty
 there's nothing to feel guilty about
 a lot of them I don't even talk about but being close to my family is one of the things that I never did and I and I and I regret that
 tell me about the hardest decision ever had
 I said there was a lot of decision hard decision that I made but I never made them
 I can say what you can say I took the easy way out maybe
 tell me about Nevada
 don't know
 have you ever
 yes
 alright then again not good
 it's hard to explain
 don't know how to even start it
 UPS down depression
 dealing with going back to school money
 I hit you can say I hit rock bottom and I'm starting my life over again
 yeah that's because of no longer doing things that I ain't supposed to do
 but it's hard
 can you tell me about that
 well from a previous addict
 why do I get to that I don't know
 I'm not even to share all I know is that I was just doing the wrong things at the wrong time got me to so much trouble
 now I'm starting over cuz I lost everything
 but I'm happy about how I'm starting now
 it's slow but kind of like an adventure at the same time there's a lot of things that I'm thinking about as well a lot of things that I can't forget
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I can't I'm under sleep meds
 two types and sometimes I can't even fall asleep it'll take I can't take more than I
 I'm prescribed
 but I have problems sleeping
 why
 I really don't know why
 bad dreams
 past events
 thoughts to keep on popping up
 bad mood depression
 I'm not too sure
 irritable on edge
 you can say sometimes I'll be walking around back if I'm tense from worried about something
 more less worried about falling asleep when I'm sleeping
 I believe so yes just currently not too long ago
 currently filing my claim
 yes that's one thing I didn't been diagnosed with for sure
 I don't like it I hate it I don't know if I can pull out of it
 I don't even think the medication that I'm even using even helps
 I'm still trying to get try different ones apparently there's enough out there that I can go through
 maybe more than a year ago
 about a year ago for my depression
 isolation not really talking with anybody
 I wouldn't really be so like a people person communication wasn't all time low
 I will be mainly staying at the house I wouldn't be going out I wouldn't be doing events or doing the things that I would like to do
 none of us was alone with my addiction as well
 that's one thing I can't figure out is what the hell trigger though
 why am I like this
 why am I actually doing things or did the things that I do or did
 coming in Natick
 not communicating with my family
 I wasn't I wasn't like this before
 how do you cope with them
 I don't know
 the only thing I got on my side of the gym it's the one place that I know I can release a lot of tension
 that one place where I know I don't have to talk to people but we're all together they're doing the same thing we're all doing the same thing and exercising and getting physically well
 the only place where I know that I can relax
 certain events that took place
 I lost certain loved ones
 I lost certain relation lost a relationship
 I don't talk to my family and I think I said that already
 got in trouble with the law yeah it is
 you still go to therapy
 yes I go to a couple of them
 you feel therapy in Hughesville
 sometimes sometimes not depending what the the topic is
 or we're probably talking about the same thing over again
 the changes that I've noticed maybe a little bit less stress knowing that I have a couple more skills or tools to cope with my depression PTSD
 not knowing when I'm going to have an outburst
 controlling myself here in there
 but it's it's a long process also on my recovery is going to be a forever process
 when I made up with my girlfriend that was what two days ago
 we are you and I talked about it with her and she was able to hear me out and I was able to hear her out and we fix things so that was the happiest moment so far
 that's great
 my case managers
 done to my my group sessions
 and my girlfriend even though it's much of a bitch she is she still good person
 he asks why I have one best friend right now
 and it's funny that you have because now that I remember he referred me as a saint which I don't think I do that I don't think I am that but I'm sure everybody's trying to say is that I'm a good person and I'm trying to do right and I don't want to inflict harm on nobody and I just want to get myself put back together and continue on you know start a new life yeah he did tell me something like that and I do consider you my best friend pretty cool they said that
 what's something you did
 recently what I really enjoyed
 fishing I went with my friend Mikey fishing you caught a couple fish very quiet very fun
 kind of you got to be patient
 but it is relaxing it does take the edge off no one there to talk to no one there too
 beer round on the open
 now that's it
 that's yet to come
