number to certify recording equipment
 and please
 okay
 absolutely yes
 okay
 so how are you doing today
 you doing okay
 where you from
 born and raised in New York City
 the city life and the fast pace
 what are some things you don't
 cost of living is pretty expensive
 you travel a lot
 not recently I traveled mostly while I was in the military
 why
 the military is always on the go so most of the travel being so expensive
 I could only afford it through traveling on Military business
 for the military or outside of the military
 what you said
 akademiks foreign languages
 private security
 okay
 what's your dream job
 probably in the same industry private security that would be high paying
 or something along the lines of mental health for
 something like what we're doing right now
 was it helps provide for the family pay the bills
 you consider yourself more shy
 more outgoing than shy
 well I'm
 I watch TV and spend time with my family
 very good actually very very controlled I have two in my field
 it was with my wife and it was about finances
 wish you would
 that's a good question
 I believe I
 coming to California and leaving my oldest daughter's in Florida
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had
 leaving the military it was for finances and
 and I knew I had to go so I 1997 I made the choice and all I had known was the military so that was pretty hard
 tell me about Nevada
 probably some of my past before the military
 I was in a relationship
 not a not a girlfriend boyfriend relationship I was
 basically victimized by my mother I wish I could erase that but in a way it kind of makes me who I am
 yes almost 9 years US Air Force
 18 years old
 had no other choice it was either go in the military or stay out on the streets in New York City I had no money for college and no chance of getting a good job so I enlisted
 are you happy you did that yes absolutely probably the best choice Inn in fixing
 my life growing up that I ever made
 three separate times yes
 I had some Growing Pains at first it was a little bit difficult in the beginning but I adjusted
 private security
 and then law enforcement
 it gave me a sense of
 sense of regimentation it gave me
 structure that I wouldn't have otherwise gotten and I believe as far as within people
 and in just the the general population that does set you aside with set you apart
 alright I guess in a bit of a struggle sometimes
 just seeking employment and it's very difficult especially with the way things are
 have you noticed any changes in your
 not really just trying to trying to land that dream job as you said before
 pretty easy especially if I've been active throughout the day and that's usually every day
 what are you like
 tired first of all
 and can't concentrate well
 yes I have
 long time ago
 my goodness 19
 90
 1992
 1992
 cold sweats
 nightmares night terrors
 disorientation waking up
 not knowing where I am
 things of that sort
 are you triggered by something
 not that I'm aware of it was
 it was almost mostly
 following one of my combat experiences in South America
 I went to Columbia
 one on President Bush's War on Drugs and
 we had the
 wait we had to live in the jungle and while in the jungle we also had to take a couple of lives while we were there we so that was one of the three instances that I saw Combat Action
 I learned a long time ago that you have to put your past behind you so
 I I just do I had to put it behind me it was
 not easy
 but it was the right thing
 to do and it was so That Others May Live so it was it may not have felt right at the time but it was the right thing to do
 what country is this
 in the military when you have a combat-related experience you always go through a debrief
 at the debrief you are asked if you need help coping with the situation
 so of course I immediately raised my hand told him I need help with coping with the situation it took roughly about
 want to say somewhere around three weeks to a month of seeing a therapist
 and
 once they they gave me some key exercises to do the the acuteness of the night terrors in the nightmares went away
 it was at first
 and very seldom am I bothered by it now because it was so long ago
 no absolutely not
 why did you stop
 I didn't need it anymore I learned enough coping skills that we're good enough to be able to cast that aside and not depend upon any facet of treatment or anything else
 you feel therapy in Haysville
 yes I do feel it is
 throwing medication at that kind of problem
 sometimes it's necessary but in my case I don't feel it is and I will not be dependent upon medications but the therapy 100% I agree especially speaking to somebody when I'm one it does help
 can you tell me about that
 tell you about the therapy and how effective it is
 I don't go to therapy anymore
 I only went for a months after my Combat Action in Columbia
 when was the
 really happy about 3 weeks ago
 can you tell me about that
 it was on payday
 didn't have very many positive role models of very few especially in my childhood I had a lot of negative examples on what not to be
 so positive role models are probably say most of my superiors in the military that was my biggest growth experience in my life
 how'd your best friend
 as his big brother the guy who taught him everything my best friend feels that
 I helped him out in building himself up work-wise
 watch my daughter
 do some martial arts at her school I really enjoy that all the time
 my daughter's my three daughters
 you're very welcome already
