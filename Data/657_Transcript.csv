 I'm not a therapist
 I'm pleased

 I'm fine and yourself
 where are you from originally
 I'm from Long Beach California
 I love the weather I love
 different things that La has to offer like food and different events that they always have especially during the summer months
 what are some things you don't really
 I hate the traffic
 you travel a lot
 yes I do
 I just love to experience new things this world has so many things to offer and I don't want to be juice in clothes in a box when there's so much out there that I can see
 I'd like to hear about one of your trips
 well
 one of my trips that stands out the most was when I went to his Israel
 that's pretty much where God was born and
 I got to see where the cross was where they laid his body after he was crucified so it was really am I opening experience
 which one of your most
 probably
 probably seeing where
 they sing the location where they had the cross where Jesus was crucified was was probably the most memorable experience
 I study criminal justice
 what are you doing now
 I do maintenance
 then it is located in West LA
 what's your dream
 my dream job honestly is to become a police officer
 you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
 when I was younger more shy but as I've gotten older I've grown out of that so now I consider myself more outgoing
 why
 I think that has come along with age because of with age comes more responsibility so you have to learn how to talk to people have to learn how to talk to different types of people and along with that the shyness kind of goes away by by default
 tell me about your relationship with your family
 oh man I can I honestly cannot ask for a better relationship with my family at all I have great parents I have great siblings I have four sisters everything about about them is great
 sometimes when I'm feeling
 I turn on the
 to relax honestly will my favorite music artist Sade so what I like to do is turn off the TV if it's hot out turn the fan on and I'll listen to some Sade
 how are you
 very well actually I don't have a temper I've never had a temper so it's I find it quite easy to control it whenever I find myself getting mad but since I don't have have a temper it's pretty easy to control it
 prop probably a week ago
 yeah I would say about a week ago and it was with one of my co-workers because they felt that I treated them differently than my other co-workers which will actually is not the case
 what's something you feel guilty about
 sometimes I feel guilty when I come into work a few minutes late but I sign in as if I sign in on time for work
 tell me about the hardest decision
 the hardest decision I've ever had to make was deciding whether or not if I wanted to join the military
 I change I would necessarily say I changed my mind but I was very curious about it but I wasn't sure but I made the decision to go even though it was scary
 but that honestly was probably my hardest decision to make
 tell me about an event or something that you wish you could have
 okay what event was when I was I was very little and the church that I was going to have the time they had they had set up this event where a bus will come and pick up all the all the kids and take him to Chuck E cheese
 what ended up happening was the bus never never like never showed up so we were sitting there for literally about an hour and a half closer to ours and the bus never showed up and everybody was heartbroken
 I know that's not really anything major but I mean I wish I could take take that away
 have you ever
 yes I have
 when I join the military I was 21
 to be honest I wanted a change in my life I wanted something different I feel like the military
 would be a really great stepping stone just in life. As well as
 they they help me pretty much pay for school so that and plus I got I got to travel so and and you know like it's always a great opportunity to serve my country you know
 are you happy you did that
 I am very happy that I that I join the Navy yes
 did you ever see combat I did not see any combat
 honestly it was kind of a struggle it wasn't that easy at first
 easy well I mean it wasn't difficult but it was a struggle
 because it's two different Lifestyles you know the natrol the military and civilian lifestyles are two completely different lifestyle so it was a lot more freedom going back and trying to the most difficult part was trying to find a job because I had came out right when the economy crashed so that was the most difficult part of my transition
 to do after the military
 I went to school and I had a student job at the
 it changed me because I feel like it's giving me more driving life to go after the things that I want I feel like I'm slightly more and more discipline
 honestly I feel like after I join the military I speak up for myself a lot more often
 how have you been
 lately I've been feeling great I don't have any complaints
 I'm happy with my life so lately I've been feeling very happy and then satisfied
 that's good
 have you noticed any changes
 not necessarily in my thoughts but in my behavior I'm finding that I'm taking more of a initiative with work and
 you know I'm with my peers in my family
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 on a regular basis I find it pretty easy
 when I don't sleep well I'm not really different I just feel like I have a little less energy throughout the day but that's really the only difference I I'm I'm still the same person
 no I have not
 okay
 have you been diagnosed
 no I have not
 when was the last
 the last time I fell really happy was probably when I got my paycheck yesterday
 someone has been a positive influence in my life probably my father he's always putting me in the in in the right direction now I'm here he's always
 give me some great advice just about things of things in life in general you know so I can always go to him
