alright how you doing
 Northern Illinois
 two and a half years ago
 haven't yet since I've been here
 haven't had a chance to going to go back later this year
 colder or warmer
 work
 took a little while but I got used to it
 no weather variations comparative traffic
 sunlight
 a little bit
 seeing different things
 been to Europe a couple of times
 been around the country
 visiting Yosemite and Sequoia parks for fun
 depends on the circumstance most of the time I can fake outgoing or try to be outgoing
 try to relax and breathe through it and move on
 depends on the context
 probably yesterday my children about them not doing what they were told to do
 arguments with my wife where I should have probably been more patient and understanding
 sometimes when it's more of a hormonal. Like this week I should just probably breathe through things and recognize that she's going through things and I should just be more patient
 what else can I do with my life
 ZZ when I was 19 I could just decide to do strange difficult things and had the boldness to follow through with him
 Hebrew and Semitic studies and classics
 kind of
 I'm in Ministry
 that's working out the way I kind of wanted to be
 some embarrassing things when I was a teenager probably
 what is wrong
 I talked to my parents about once a day maybe once every other day and
 I'm constantly talk with my wife and children
 got four of them they keep me very busy between 9 and 3
 sometimes most of the time now
 character development recognizing that they need space to grow
 when it works and you see character development and growth and
 an exploration
 I have more standards more willingness to enforce standards
 my wife
 she's been there for me for 15 years now and
 help give me the self-confidence to be who I am
 better now that I'm not drinking as much pop tonight
 irritable
 shorter temper
 pretty good pretty good now I'm doing and making some better decisions with my diet is doing better
 feel a bit more empowered not as defeatist I was in a process where I wasn't eating very well as an exercising wasn't able to get doing those things I've been doing a little better at that recently passed you weeks and that's been a little bit more encouraging
 have you ever been
 no
 really happy
 probably a few weeks ago at the beach when everybody was having a good time
 confident
 loud
 intelligent
 I guess
 more patient
 more able to
 automatically engage with people as opposed to being hesitant at first
 oh middle school and I was always the
 low man on the totem pole socially
 being a constant butt of jokes
 don't fall in the Trap of thinking that Middle High School is life
 send you a bill weekend
 sometime you know if was children and family doing some fun activity Beecher Museum or something
 some time with the wife sometime just by myself to read and kind of refocus
 something you did
 participate in some high-level academic discussions
 driving able to
 maintain the standard and quality of life for myself and my family have been able to do so far
