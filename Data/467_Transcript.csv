yeah I'm okay with it
 I feel pretty good little nervous
 because I've never done anything like this before that's why
 from Ohio Cincinnati
 two months ago two and a half months
 I was just looking for
 wanted to be in a new environment
 oh yeah I'm ecstatic
 very happy
 I took a few weeks just to get adjusted
 cuz I don't know it
 the weather is probably the best thing
 yeah I know
 been other than that pretty much the same as everywhere else I've been
 it's nothing I don't really like about la
 since you know the weather is the best part of it
 I like to travel somewhat I haven't travelled a lot of my life but over the past year-and-a-half I've done done quite a bit of traveling
 seeing different places different people new people new faces
 new places
 but she lasts will last summer I spent the summer in Cleveland doing the urban farming
 in the city
 I stayed at a hospital the first hospital in Cleveland
 and I was at doing program with the
 and it was basically we would go to different Urban Farms throughout the city and volunteer
 about 20 25 hours a week
 oh yeah
 really a spur-of-the-moment type of thing
 wanted to try something different something I've never done before
 and farming is one of those things that you know most people would never try
 cuz of a you know cuz of a certain stigma that comes along with it
 and you know I just thought it would be fun and interesting to do something like that
 what in the urban farming or in general
 Urban farming
 how do I guess
 I don't know just just the overall experience is going you know eating and going to the farmers markets and eating all the fresh food and just send the difference in
 you know how fresh natural food tasted you know as opposed to the foodie by the grocery store
 yeah it is really this
 I was I took two semesters of a college and I was undecided so I was just taking General classes
 my dream job
 it's my dream job with the D
 anything that involves I don't know how like a specific dream job or anything that involves nature just being outside I would like to I wouldn't mind being like a like a forest ranger or something like that
 as long as I have you know yeah
 consider myself more shy
 don't like don't know why it's just the way it is
 I read
 listen to music
 a draw
 watch movies stuff like that
 I think I'm pretty good at it
 I think yeah
 wow
 yeah I can't remember the last time I hear argument with someone
 I don't know
 again I don't know because
 I don't
 dwell on things that happened in the past
 maybe whether or not to come to California I guess that was a hard decision
 well
 I don't know I've been thinking about it you know moving to a new place for a long time
 and I guess
 hardest part of the decision was
 thinking weather
 whether or not I will be secure or not you know what I mean just going to a new place we don't know anyone
 kind of
 are you really don't know what's going to happen
 so
 there was a lot of
 you know fear not in that decision should I go to a place where I don't know anyone I don't I'm not familiar with the area you know only only perception of a hat that I have of this area's you know what I've seen on it and media media and TV
 so you know yeah I guess that was the hardest hardest decision that I can think of
 I guess so
 nothing absolutely nothing
 yeah
 nothing
 I don't feel guilty about anything
 relationship with my family
 I'm not really close to my family
 I guess the person
 I'm closest to as my mom but you know I don't you know I never really talked to her much
 I don't really know my dad that well so you know
 guess my grandmother
 yeah she yes she's
 she's very
 how should I say it
 she's very to The Thinker I put it like that like she's very insightful so
 you look so her
 for a lot of advice because she's been through a lot through a lot in her life
 I feel like she you know she's been through a lot so she understands a lot so let you know
 she's a very positive influence
 very easy
 maybe unsure
 I would say
 because
 right now I really don't know
 what direction I want to go in with my life
 and it's been a lot of confusion with that
 but you know it's not
 it's not something that overly affects me but you know it's always a thought in the back of my mind felt feels like somehow
 maybe I'm running out of time
 I know that's not like that's not it that's not a realistic thought because
 I don't see how you could ever run out of time but
 yeah I guess yeah
 just general not knowing what I want
 but I know like how do I cope with that
 how do I cope with that
 I don't know I just do a lot of thinking a lot of soul-searching
 it's not hard I mean I mean
 it's like I can't say it's hard because it's one of those things that I feel like it's necessary
 and
 you know certain things in life you just you're forced to face
 so it's harder to I think it's harder to avoid those type of things
 no
 no
 no
 today
 when I talk when I talk to my friend earlier
 awesome
 how would my best friend describe me
 I guess you would say I'm quiet
 if you describe me as a nice guy
 insightful
 Goofy
 no I don't really think like that
 no
 10 or 20 years ago I guess I will tell myself to
 stick with whip what stick with what I love
 did a
 acting Workshop
 and numb
 I don't know if I've always been interested mine
 and I decided why not no try it so you like it
 what am I most proud of
 like an event or an accomplishment
 cuz I pride myself on being independent
