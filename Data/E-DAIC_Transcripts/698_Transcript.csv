 I was adopted so my relationship with my family

 I listen to music and I pray
 I pray I listen to music and imma just meditate on positive things take a walk ride a bike read a book things like that
 didn't used to be very good at it but throughout the years going through hard times and learning the hard way I've learned to control my temper pretty well now it takes a lot to get me to give me angry I'm more passive now than I ever have been and I I like that about myself
 when was the last time
 I argued with my best friend probably wasn't like a real serious argument but we argued a little bit about a religion which I don't like to go into a r i don't like 2 to get into arguments about but unfortunately we got into argument about religion she wanted me to she wants me to join her religion I don't feel like it's right what I should do and I so we got into a little dispute about that
 better situation that
 Etsy
 there's many many many situations that I wish I had it handled differently and one of them was my children I wish I could have been
 I wish I could have been a better dad to my kids I wish I could have made better decisions for my children and I didn't
 what's something you feel guilty about my guilt I feel guilty about that about not being a good parent to my kids at many times in my life and that guilt stays with me my whole life everyday I think about it
 tell me about
 let's see the hardest dishes decision I've ever had to make
 I wish I could erase from my memory
 the last time that
 having
 getting divorced would be one of the last things with the memory of that relationship going bad was probably one of the things of the last excuse me one of the things I'd like to erase from my memory
 the last time I interacted with my ex-wife
 yeah I was in the Navy
 how old are you
 I was 18
 just a kid
 well to be honest with you I was 18 years old and I didn't have anywhere else to go I was homeless and it was either be homeless on the street at 18 or join the military and try to do something with my life and so that's what I chose to do
 are you happy you did
 yeah
 in a way out you know I got out I got out of the military and wish I had stayed in longer so yeah It ultimately I'm glad I did that
 no never saw combat I was in an 80 86 and 87 those years and I was in the Cold War era I was stationed on the
 and my ship was dry dock for a little while so I didn't I didn't see combat they didn't have combat at that time
 how easy was it for you to go
 I think it was too easy for me I just did actually I just did real well getting out and and I'm getting back into civilian life I went in with it with both feet running and so yeah it was it was wasn't hard at all
 alright
 what did you do
 after the military
 I work several different jobs looking didn't thinking about what career I wanted to choose I apply for the sheriff's department didn't make the sheriff's department but got into working for different private investigative companies at that time and that's how I ended up working and getting into Workman's Comp fraud and different surveillance and investigative aspects of a private investigation so I work 5 investigation a little time after getting out of the military
 how did serving in the military change you
 it taught me honor atami dignity you taught me respect it it taught me how to
 to Listen and Obey chain of command it kind of grew me up a GroupMe app from a kid to a man in a lot of ways like I said I wish I had stayed in longer to have grown more but I did
 how have you been feeling lately
 lately I been feeling
 just really I don't know just kind of worthless you know depressed a lot kind of a little bit worthless. Feeling like I don't know maybe a little bit a little lack of Hope in a lot of ways not knowing what my future holds and I guess you could say and I don't know just feeling a little down in the last couple weeks
 have you noticed any changes in her behavior
 yeah this feeling kind of hopeless and just depressed and not having a lot of energy and and
 like I said just feeling down just feeling just feeling down about myself now not feeling worthy you know those kind of feelings
 all right
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 depends on the night sometimes I I sleep really well other nights it's Restless I have bad dreams things like that but lately I've just been kind of feeling depressed I've been sleeping too much
 what are you
 sometimes I get irritable
 I can't think straight I might my mind's a jumble
 are you
 I just can't think straight and and irritable and may be cranky things like that
 yes
 yes I am actually take medication for to get counseling for it and I've been dealing with that for a little while now but yeah I have been diagnosed with PTSD
 how long ago when he died
 nice excuse me several years ago
 my earphones coming off a little bit but yeah several years ago
 Tremors at night nightmares depression
 feeling feeling low something something bad is going to happen to me at all times you know that's how I felt when I was in the military I feel like our ship was going to be bombed anytime just being feeling a sense of Terror a lot of the time
 are they triggered by something no that's the strange part about it it's just
 it's just the way I feel I don't know why it's like that I can't tell you but it's it's it's the way the way I've been feeling for 4 years ever since I was in the military I feel that way now like we're going to get bombed something's going to happen at any moment a cast is going to break out things like that and I can hate it I wish it was like that which I didn't think that way
 how do you cook with them
 isolate sometimes and and try to I pray I believe in God so I pray and I try to get him to comfort me in and help me to get through the the scary feelings I feel and I try to get support from the little friends I have in the few family members I have and I just try to tell myself everything's going to be okay it's it's not what I'm thinking you know things aren't the way I think they're they are in my head those those kind of coping mechanisms
 I couldn't take it anymore I was having a
 still pressing up in the hospital
 this feeling like I said feeling tired of being scared all the time couldn't I just couldn't deal with it anymore so I ended up getting help and I'm glad I did and it's a day-by-day struggle I still struggle everyday to to do Skip by but I basically I'm doing okay I'm hanging in there
 it's very hard
 yeah I go to therapy like probably once a month I take meds for it helps me out a lot
 I probably should be going to therapy more but it's once a month right now
 all right
 you feel therapy in Hughesville
 I think it's useful if you're serious about it and you take it seriously and you have the right therapist and everything is
 the right Dynamics are there I think it's very useful yeah
 well I think that
 if you if you go if you're going just to go it's not going to help if you're going to seat the true answers to get help I think it's it's going to it's going to work it's good you're going to get help it's good things will work out but if you've got the wrong person to talk to their that the chemistry is not there or the education or whatever Dynamics are involved aren't working they're not in sync with each other either on your side of the of the therapist is there is going to be
 more difficult for the for the solution to be a positive when I think
 I don't know I I I don't know if I said that properly but basically yeah
 let's sort of changes have I noticed
 I'm more of a positive person actually that I that I ever have been was completely negative about everything for so many years I'm more positive I have more hope even though I have days of hopelessness more hope I feel more secure Within Myself and I feel like I've got a release I've got somebody that I could talk to
 that will then understands me and somebody that could really relate with
 when is the
 you know
 I don't remember the last time I was very happy to be honest with you I don't remember
 it's a
 I don't remember it's been a long time
 let's see my brother my older brother
 he's a real positive influence in my life my best friend
 she's a rub super positive person in my life every time I start talking negative or looking down on things she always reminds me be positive be positive and that helps a lot and she's there to encourage me and those two people right there or play a big role in my life
 how do your best friend is
 oh boy I have I think she probably describe me as
 somebody that needs to take things more seriously when it comes to his health is spirituality life itself
 somebody that has a lot of issues but yet she cares very much about
 tell me about something you did recently
 let's see something I've done recently that I've really enjoyed that I've really enjoyed I enjoyed going over my brother's house and watching seeing him work on his Harley-Davidson he's building a Harley-Davidson from the ground up so I enjoyed going over there and seeing him get almost finished building this Harley from the ground up that was something I really enjoyed doing
 nice
