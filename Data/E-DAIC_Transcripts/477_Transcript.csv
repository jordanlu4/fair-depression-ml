okay sounds good thanks
yes thanks
 I am well thank you how are you
 I grew up in Oklahoma
 I moved La about five and a half years ago so I used to be on the wet on the east coast and then I decided I wanted to come out here
 my hometown not very often most of my families moved away so I visit them but I don't actually get back to Oklahoma March
 Oklahoma's very different Ellie is a lot more exciting there's a lot more to do here and the ocean obviously is very nice
 you know that's a good question I I wanted to try something new and I've always loved the beach and I thought I also like big cities so I thought La might be a good place for me to come
 very it's probably one of the best decisions I ever made
 Kizi I think it seems kind of natural that seems like a good fit I just really like it here
 that's great I have a couple of roommates and we get along really well I live a couple of blocks from the beach and every day I get to walk on the beach or you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice
 I studied philosophy and political theory in government and did a little bit of English literature on the side
 it kind of just happened naturally I think I went to a liberal arts school and got kind of exposure to a lot of different areas and I just followed what I liked was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that
 not exactly I work for an educational non-profit so I work with grad with graduate students in the social sciences and Humanities but I don't actually use my philosophy background very often
 you know I haven't actually study to become a success coach and so I working with students has is kind of a nice aspect of of doing that but I'd really like to work with with other people so I'm not just students but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams
 hey it it's fairly hard I'm in the sense that
 you know it can be challenging for people to actually be motivated and do all the work that needs to be undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but it's also a challenge because making a living at it requires charging people money so I'm finding people who are willing to pay for that can be difficult to
 I'm definitely on the Shire side I'm an introvert so
 I'm pretty good in one-on-one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a couple of people I very much an observer so I tend to listen a lot and I'm not as engaged and I think that is something that goes it is noticed by others and it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted so I bet say and it's also challenge 10 not to be the person who introduces myself in a room full of strangers
 pretty good I think but I do have a temper so I can get I can get upside from time to time
 really it can be a challenge when I'm driving but other than that no
 I'm not sure
 it would have probably been a discussion over politics and it probably would have been a friendly argument probably with one of my liberal friends so but I actually can't remember the specific time
 I meditate I do that almost every day I also walk at the beach I love the ocean and I really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful and I like to read and be alone just with my thoughts so that's nice
 well let me think about that for a minute
 having a hard time coming up with anything I mean I'm sure there are plenty of things just nothing comes to mind
 okay I'm sorry
 well this isn't exactly an event it's with the dream and it's not a particularly traumatic dreams as far as dreams go but I do have it sometimes probably more often than I like so I wouldn't be upset if it even if I didn't have it and it's just a version of a dream that I think a lot of people probably have but it's usually me in school somewhere at the end of the semester haven't gone to class taking the exams know I'm going to fail and you know really unhappy about it wishing why did my studying attend class the way I should have which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now I have the stream sometimes and it's kind of frustrating and I'm not exactly sure
 why I mean I know why but I don't know what it applies to because it's not like I am worried consciously at least about failing things so
 no I don't think so at least not not that I'm aware of
 I feel guilty I have a brother and a sister in law and a nephew and they live on the east coast and I love my nephew he's 8 he's adorable and I when I used to live there when he was younger I spent a lot of time with them and since I've been in California and particularly in the last year I spent a lot less time visiting them so for example I saw them for week of Christmas and then I went back and I think beginning of May so it was you know for months between the the last time I'd seen them and that I felt bad about because we really enjoy each other's company and he you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when I leave and he asked when am I coming back so that some
 that makes me feel bad sometimes
 well I have a brother I'm very close to him he's younger and
 he's like for four and a half years younger he's married I have a nephew my both my parents have passed away so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them with most of them on my father's side there's one brother and he's married and has if you could drive to cousins on that side then on my mother's side there are
 545 other kids most of them with several children of their own so I have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and so we stay in touch a little bit through Facebook and they're a couple that I talk to you on the phone and visit every now and then but you know we're not that close with our extended family so
 say it well
 I have a lot of friends I think that have been positive influences
 when I came out to California and I started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place is very different from what I was used to it was a little bit challenging and she also work there so we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and we just established this really strong friendship and she's kind of I would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general and now she's moved to Vegas which is a little bit tough for me but we're going to Napa this weekend so that should be good but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when I came out here to really know anybody in a know since I'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends is really nice because we share a lot of same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know I think she kind of gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice
 how is your day
 I'm a sleeper so it's pretty easy sometimes my you know depending on how long I've been awake I can be without a little wound up and somehow got to take a little while to decompress but I usually meditate right before I go to bed and that's very helpful and I can sleep
 I generally sleep in 90-minute Cycles so usually six or seven and a half hours but I can easily sleep 9 hours if I have the time and inclination I usually don't wake up in the middle of the night or at least if I do I don't remember it so
 well I actually don't sleep very well when I travels one of the things I do for work is I travel quite a bit because I work for a company that's back East so I work from home most of the time but then I travel like one week a month and when I travel I'll take the red-eye and then I'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so I don't sleep that much it's not that I sleep poorly or badly it's just that I don't have that much time to sleep and the first day after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay usually the second day it's not very good sounds like a lot more tired and it's harder to concentrate and I don't know it just feels like more of a struggle
 good summerisle is an is a busy time for the organization that I work for so I'm a little I don't know stressed is the right word but you know a little anxious about everything going well this summer but in general I'm feeling pretty good
 really I can't I can't do anything there is one thing I am I do struggle with exercise like I like to walk a lot and I hike with friends and I have been really motivated about it for a couple of months but then I went away to the east coast when I came back I was a lot less motivated cuz I didn't really exercise when I was there and I gotten out of the Habit even though it only been about ten days and so now I'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as I would like
 it's okay thank you
 now
 now
 well
 he's a lot of fun and he really likes me and I really like him and we play a lot of games and talked a lot and actually doing a book club now so we're going to Skype and may God is more time with him that way but just being around him is fun
 well she probably say that I know how to have fun but that I can be serious
 and
 that I care about others and that I'm loyal and
 I'm not sure what else
 I think those those are probably the main things
 I wish I had more self-discipline so I wish that you know I could die it or eat healthier foods and not have a problem with sugar because I love to eat sugar I wish that I would not procrastinate because I've gotten a lot better about that but I still do and I can be challenging and I wish that I
 I don't know
 I wish that I was in a relationship so
 probably those things
 so the last organization I used to work at I had a boss and she was I don't feel like she was
 I don't think we were very compatible and she used to push my buttons or so I thought and so
 a one day she was really upset about something because a board member had called her up and asked her a question if she didn't have the answer and he was upset about something and it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was but it wasn't I I've been a manager for many years and I have very strong opinions about how you handle challenges with with staff members and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate I thought I meant she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel incompetent or at least that's the way that I felt about it and
 I did you know I tried to be very calm and said that I would take care of it and I did take care of it but after that our relationship wasn't really the same and I ended up leaving there to go back to the old organization that I work for not that long afterwards because I just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me or after we had that interactions
 so I heard this piece of advice the other day and or this thing and then I thought it's really profound and I wish that I had read it back then which is when you think about buying something instead of thinking oh here's this beautiful coat it's $100 I want it I'm going to buy it I don't think of it is costing $100 think of it is costing 10 times that because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it you know intelligently you would have 10 times that much money eventually so you should really think about it in those terms and I think I've been much more consumer than a saber and so I wish that I had to been more aware of that 10 or 20 years ago
 probably
 they asked me to be his god parent and his Guardian if anything should happen to them and that meant a lot to me because of it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that I was a good person the kind of person that could take care of their child should something happen to them so
 let's see
 well it wasn't really recently but in February I went I like to travel and a friend and I went to Singapore and I got to fly first class is miles of frequent flyer miles to get the tickets and so that was really enjoyable because the seats fold down to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and I also hadn't been to Singapore before so that was kind of cool to
 sure thank you bye
 hey
