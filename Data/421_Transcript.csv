 I'm okay how are you
 originally I'm from San Francisco
 originally I moved here in gosh 1995 then I went to Chicago then to San Francisco and then back to Los Angeles probably about 5 years ago
 a lot of moving
 never
 there just isn't anything there for me anymore
 the weather is better in LA but the people in San Francisco are nicer
 my husband prefer my ex-husband prefers at here that's why we moved
 okay
 I have an undergraduate degree in Psychology and after that I went to law school
 when I was in college I worked at a law firm and decided that I really wanted to be a lawyer it was really interesting
 are you still working in that no now I'm a stay-at-home mom
 you find it easy to be a parent know I loved it but it is it is difficult you have to manage a life to make sure that they become a good and successful person
 it's easy to kind of do the academics and stuff like that you know I'm good at that the hardest thing I think is to guide them emotionally to help him through things that he's having a hard time with feeling like I don't have all the answers
 I'm just seeing them grow and and experience new things and learn about life in the world it's just it's really really cool
 what are some ways that your
 completely different completely different and I am not a perfect parent but I love my son I take care of him he's the first priority in my life and they weren't like that at all
 well my parents are dead I didn't speak to my dad at all before he died I have a sister and a brother that actually I don't know where they are I don't speak to them either
 do you consider yourself more shy
 probably more shy because I consider myself more reserved
 I like to listen to music
 like what I have I listen to all sorts of music but my favorite when I'm relaxing is that 80s music cheesy cheesy but true
 it depends on who I'm with if I'm with my son I can control my temper if I'm with my ex-husband or other adults yeah I don't
 so so
 yesterday and it was about my ex-husband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married
 can you tell me about that
 I found out he was cheating on me and I kicked him out and he told me yesterday that he's continuing to date her
 yeah
 really angry
 and just really hurt
 I wish that I had talked to my dad before he died I wish that I had settled our differences before he had died
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to
 the hardest decision I've ever had to make was actually ending my marriage
 because he was cheating on me
 that would have to be
 well I don't know I mean I don't know if I'd want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me who I am today
 but I can't really think of one event that I would want to erase
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I don't get a good night sleep it's not easy I wake up a lot in the night
 I don't know I wish I knew if I knew I could change it I could try to do something about it but I I just don't I don't know
 what are you like when you don't
 grumpy irritable
 grumpy irritable down
 mixed with anger
 can you tell me about
 it's just because of everything that I'm going through with my soon-to-be ex-husband
 yeah there's
 I just keep it inside
 Meador Staffing else to really do except I mean it is what it is so
 I have to
 deal with it
 no
 yes
 10 years ago after my son was born
 9 years ago I felt like I couldn't cope with life
 I was so down I couldn't I felt like I couldn't do anything
 I need
 no
 I don't go to therapy I go to medication management but I don't do talk therapy
 I have gone to a therapist and no they don't help
 can you tell me if
 well some just sit and stare at you and don't say anything you know if I wanted to talk to myself I would others give advice that I think is just
 it just not not good and not on point
 tell me about the last time you felt
 it was probably this morning I was playing with my son
 just really happy I wasn't thinking about
 any of the other crap
 in my life I could just forget it so I was feeling really really happy
 I think they would describe me completely different from the way I would describe me but I think they would describe me as really sweet they have really sweet confident
 outgoing because that's what I try to be two people so I think that's how they would describe me
 I wish I wasn't sad I wish I was more confident
 yeah there are a lot of things I think
 it would be
 to not
 not give my life over to one particular person which is what I did with my husband
 find your ideal weekend
 I think I would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like Palm Springs with my son hanging around the pool having fun going out to dinner
 one of my two of my friends to really good girlfriend so I think have been really positive influences in my life
 can you tell me if
 sure life is worse than mine and the but we can always commiserate together
 is just really positive me she's always happy always up always look into the bright side so that has helped me a lot
 my son
 I went over to a friend's house and we had movie night we watch the grown up movie and had dinner and wine and the boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games and it was just a relaxed fun evening
 thanks for sharing your thoughts with me
 my
 okay
