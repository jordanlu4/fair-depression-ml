I look like a cancer patient
 okay so now I'm going to
 yes
 I'm good
 Iowa
 when are y
 2001
 holidays and special family events
 it's much better there
 and I E I got into UCLA went to UCLA for three years
 in the screenwriting program
 it took a long time it was difficult
 just the
 getting used to and managing the stress of everyday living
 variety of right here like that
 Dallas traffic
 internationally no
 just haven't had reason to I guess
 I have a BS in math and physics
 I went to school later in life and I wanted to actually know something
 so it was very difficult very difficult but I did it why
 fascinated me I didn't want to be intimidated by it
 oh yeah
 to be employed writer
 stream Lee difficult extremely difficult writing any type of fictional fiction ride is extremely difficult I worked as hard as I do now when I was in school I have a PhD in math and physics
 it's so hard
 outgoing
 at the present circumstance it's it's not a catch all depends on the the moment
 what I do to relax I swim
 swam one last Friday
 Friday
 what do I do when I am annoyed
 swear to myself
 pretty good pretty good takes a lot to get me to express anger
 but I do
 it was in traffic actually
 that was probably two weeks ago in traffic
 sure
 I'm just waiting for the lights and some kind of pickups honking at me and like why humpback so he didn't like that he pulled up alongside me I had to have no idea what his problem was and we had a few words
 I mean I have no idea what I was doing wrong
 swipe the light
 guilty that's a strong word
 if I feel guilty as I feel remorseful about actions or words
 said and done in the past they come up
 oh just passed in interpersonal reactions with friends are family you know it'll just hit you one day you're not necessarily thinking about it for whatever reason and just out of the blue it hits you my all why they say that what I do that
 situation
 got a blank
 for me that question has a negative connotation
 so something that's possibly negative in my recent past
 what would have done differently
 I don't
 I'm pretty in control of my emotions and taking the temperature of the moment and responding my when to respond when and when not to respond
 so nothing really Springs to mind that I wish I'd done differently recently in my pass pass yes but not recently
 oh
 swallowing my pride
 putting my tail between my legs
 and saying I was wrong to friends
 I contacted him again and then we're fast friends again
 now this is again this is past past so not recent past so
 probably
 altercations I've had with my mom
 and I know things I've said to hurt her
 I know
 yeah when you
 hurt the ones that are closest to you that sticks
 so any time any one of those situations you know
 so when I think my emotional IQ has
 ground so I think in the past passed my emotional cues was stuck on infant so
 so
 I have a good relationship with my mother and both my sisters and their families my father never had a good relationship don't know if that will be possibly still alive but he's Advanced Alzheimer's so he's mad at everybody right now I was fine it was slow
 Psalm 100
 impossible Foods my life
 my sister's to talk with my sisters
 extremely easy asleep while it's night anywhere from at least 8 to 10 hours a night
 oh star Jake
 just going through the motions you know like this I like this David Lynch who is not necessarily mainstream he's done some crazy stuff are his movies and TVs concerned he said the idea of the tanks driven artist is BS because you want to be creative get a good night sleep I like that
 good I can't wait to get up and start the day
 oh if if that happens it's gradual I'm always thinking about my behavior and my thought processes and how to be more productive in my life
 with what
 pme me now I don't know I haven't been taking diagnosed with any psychological
 acronym
 no
 this weekend had a good good time with friends with great was with friends and we just were able to talk about you know some things and conversation lasted two and a half hour 3 hours to inspect it to happen was good I like talking with smart people informed people open-minded people it was a great those types of discussions are rare
 almost like how you get after running or exercising you know the endorphins it was the same thing
 I am
 ADD with friends or working on my stuff my writing
 for exercising
 my Heights I wish I were taller
 I wish
 color of the physicality I wish I didn't wear glasses
 nothing internal
 I'm patience I've been commended for my patience by strangers
 my relationships with my friends and my family I understand that it takes time and energy to maintain them and I take that time and energy
 well it's a really open general question of course now goes back are you talkin recently are you talkin in the path
 I always regret
 I regret
 the whole thing's not a big thing not being more productive or efficient in the use of my time each day
 I hate wasting time I hate wasting money I hate wasting energy
 that's a deep question
 I'd say
 I was co-dependent 10 or 20 years ago I said get some help
 get some help
 you got your coat
 sure
 I just about button
