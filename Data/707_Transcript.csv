 two days ago it was about him always slamming the door I asked him not to do it because it's very loud when it slams and he just doesn't care and and I got mad and I yell at him
 probably my marriage

 00
 probably
 some of my earlier years I in my early 20s on the things I've done
 have you ever
 yes
 17 + 1/2
 well all about five or six of my friends were going in so I want to go with him
 are you happy
 yes I I kind of wish I would have stayed in though
 no I didn't know if there was no Wars going on or conflicts going on while I was serving
 it was easy I had no problems adjusting
 I just kind of bounced around from job to job and then I I got into a little trouble went to jail for a little while then I got out and pretty much got my life together
 how did serving in the military change you it made me more confident made me physically stronger too
 that's about all I can really think of it as far as that goes
 how have you been feeling
 as a rule pretty good
 just things are starting to look up more at least financially so that's a good thing
 no not really
 how is he
 usually pretty good unless one of my roommates is walking around the house all night like you sometimes does
 little irritable
 usual I control the irritability though
 yes
 I'd say about five years ago and it was just symptoms were I was hearing voices
 paranoia
 yes but it was by an event that happened
 I am
 Jewish by birth even though I don't practice and
 I was jumped by five skinheads
 and I was able to handle two of them but the other three got me and beat me up pretty good
 how do you cope
 you know I just
 deal with it as it comes I guess you know usually I don't even have to deal with skinheads anymore because I don't see them too much but I was in that one situation where it just happened where they happen to be there
 I was tired of hearing voices and I knew I was hearing voices
 do you still go to therapy now I know I'm pretty much over that I've learned to overcome
 do you feel therapy in Gainesville
 yeah I think you can help people some some people I can't help just they're too far gone but I think
 the majority of people yes it can help
 well I think when people have a chance to
 express or vent what's going on or what's bothering them it takes away some of the tension and stress and they are better able to cope with whatever their problem is
 I've just learned to deal with things
 a lot easier
 when is the last
 oh
 how to say it was
 when I bought my last vehicle
 oh my friend
 it's been a very positive influence
 yeah he asked me if I need things he's helping me to
 be financially more secure
 through through working partially with him even though I'm retired I do a little bit of work with him and it's a way to make some extra money that's pretty much needed
 how do your best friend
 probably as honest loyal and
 be there for him whenever he needs me
 all well I'd say it was a reunions of sorts of the old Hollywood crowd that I used to hang out with
 nice
 yeah it was fun
 well of the things I had which I no longer have but I had accomplished something I had my own business I own two homes several vehicles and all the toys and everything that goes with it
 thanks for sharing your thoughts with me thank you
 yeah she's done with me
