 I'm kind of trying to
 I feel like I see the signs from other people and for been more appreciative of me and I've been more supportive of me you know going through everything and I really carrying and I feel like I'm not pushing them away
 but I feel like
 there's there's a push and pull in a situation instead of allowing myself to fall into the situation I'm I'm pushing myself away from it and that's not a bad situation but it's
 there's an under the uncertainty to it that I'm feeling whether I am misconstrued about my thoughts and I don't even have that I can't even I don't even speak I don't need to say Hey cuz I feel that
 I'm wrong in that if I do it'll be embarrassed. Embarrassing moment but no change the entire situation or something so I don't want to cross that boundary
