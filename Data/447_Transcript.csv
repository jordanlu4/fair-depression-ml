yeah that's perfectly fine
I'm feeling great it's an early morning I don't have school
 born and raised in Los Angeles California
 the fact that you can serve snowboard and like do to drastically different things in one day
 coming from the neighborhoods I've lived in I'd say the population of
 lower socio-economic backgrounds it's like a cesspool almost for young African-Americans and it sucks
 not really I've been to New York Connecticut Mexico and Texas but pretty young
 mostly if I'm traveling by plane just decide in the air is amazing it's remarkable
 the first time I went to New York I was about 11 years old and I made sure I got the the window seat on the plane and just a feeling of taking off is just exhilarating but we left at night here in LA and it was the next day in New York so it's kind of confusing getting used to the time change and the first thing I remember doing is getting a slice of New York Pizza it was it was delicious
 yep
 graduating with the bachelor's degree in Communications so I can go into the military as an officer
 what made you decide to do
 actually like would I don't know it's like you got to have a plan it's the only thing that's just falling into place and it seems like it's going to fall into place for me
 what's your dream job
 to be honest job that doesn't exist
 however you can get paid to do nothing
 yeah but probably
 I was definitely shy as a kid but I've grown into myself through the experience of college so I'm way more outspoken
 I write music and I work out mostly so if I'm feeling stressed out I just do a set of push-ups and lifting weights
 I'm pretty good I saw a therapist when I was a kid for about a year
 and I don't know if he told me to just be able to control my emotions and I don't think I do it in the best way because when I'm angry I do decide to like just bottled in my emotions instead of letting them out in their appropriate Outlets
 not really it's been more of a in interpersonal thing that's I don't know I don't know
 probably yesterday something in regards to sports the playoffs are on so things like that than Hu
 so many
 I guess in my senior year of high school I waited till the last minute to apply for the UC schools and it was unsuccessful because I didn't get to turn in applications and I'm pretty sure I would have been admitted so it sucks but hey
 tell me about
 that is an intriguing question
 I've actually no clue
 the death of my grandmother
 sure
 my grandmother died when I was 11 years old she raised me from the time I was born because my mother was unable to take care of me she raised my sister my brother and my cousin is well and her five children so she's the matriarch of our family and the closest thing I've had to a mother it was tough but it's going to be 7 years dismay next on the 30th and I've grown quite a bit No More Tears
 I'm a foster kid so I was emancipated from the Foster program about 2 years ago now but my immediate family are pretty close with him as much as I can and my foster family they're awesome I've known them since I was 5 so it's been pretty cool
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep fairly easy I fall asleep pretty quick it's not a problem except for when my back's hurting and then it's a problem
 a little moody in the morning I guess I drive more aggressively
 a little stressed about a few problems that I can take care of but I shouldn't stress because either can do something about it or I can't mess this way things work
 can you tell me about
 Usher I have a few parking ticket not parking tickets are not moving violations but their tickets and I was unaware of if you miss Court without being in the hospital or being in jail that you couldn't be excused from not been making your court date so I have 3 failure to appears in court with tickets that are thousands of dollars and I have no money so
 I don't know if it's pretty tough to deal with when you're trying to make something out of your life but
 there's so many barriers and obstacles that like you you didn't foresee so I don't know it gets stressful at times and yeah
 thinking about it for periods of times some days I just sit and I'm just lost in my thoughts and I don't really communicate to anyone because there's nothing anybody can do for me early so I just bottle it up like I do everything
 not very after doing it for so long it becomes a natural thing I believe
 no
 no
 really happy why is that such a difficult question
 I don't know I'm pretty content with everything right now I don't know about extreme happiness everyday is just the same day seems like
 dunking across the street at the Clippers center is a basketball court there and I've been working on it for a while and I finally got up yet
 I have 4 close friends that I've known for over eight years each and I don't know Studios hard-working
 determined I don't know
 yeah
 probably my metabolism which I don't really have control over some I don't know I'm pretty content with myself
 tell me about
 I think in my sixth grade year of grade school I was I wasn't the best of students but I had a teacher who was diligent and like he felt me the whole year but I learned a lot and I developed a passion for school afterwards so it was like a situation I overcome after feeling so bad and down
 the same teacher who made me feel really bad actually because it wasn't for his like sternness I don't think I would have gained the discipline to be where I am at now in college and stuff so
 I remember this time I was in the desert or up in Joshua Tree with my best friend and his dad and we actually got stuck in the mountains and like we went down a gully and his Jeep would get over a rock so it was it was pretty yes it was kind of weird and I thought I was Superman I try to move a rock that was thousands of pounds didn't work but yeah we eventually got out without going to be stuck in the desert but it was a fun time I got to drive in the desert when I didn't have my license owes fun
 about that day or in general
 other than like the UC thing like what I didn't apply to the schools and time I regret that
 I don't know I was I was 10 years old 10 years ago I probably say to myself
 no clue that's that's an interesting question
 Bing the first from my Mediacom immediate family is in my mother my brothers and my sister to go to college
 so yes it's pretty
 no problem
