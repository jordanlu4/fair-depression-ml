 I'm so lonely
 will she pick up on my
 fight
 okay
 okay
 so two things
 Booker
 everyone
 absolutely okay
 and so she can ask you a series of questions and then at the end she'll say goodbye and then you'll press this button
 yes
 I'm doing quite well
 I am from West Covina California
 the sports teams I like the Lakers the Dodgers and the USC football
 and
 and the weather
 the traffic don't like the traffic at all and
 other than that it's probably probably probably yet
 no not right now I am in a job that they're just commute back and forth about 12 miles so that's about as the extent of my traveling
 what do I enjoy about traveling probably seeing new places when I due to trouble seeing new places and people from different states different countries and picking up on their cultures
 one of my trips let's see
 I have a friend in Atlanta Georgia and he works for the TV that work down there and when the Dodgers were playing in Atlanta I took a trip to go see him and we went to go see the games as well Atlanta is a good nice Sports Town hot and muggy but we could deal with it as much like here the expressways are about the same traffic they have their own traffic problems but it was really good experience I got to see and meet people from Atlanta Georgia and it was really nice time
 one of my most memorable experiences is being in the Marine Corps and liberating Kuwait
 that was probably the one of the the best experiences of my of my life
 we had a little resistance and trouble from Saudi Arabia into Kuwait and liberate Kuwait City and there was it was great
 what I studied at school basically was broadcasting and the radio and cuz I was a radio operator in the Marine Corps so I could study broadcasting I am but I also love history
 what do you do now
 what do I do now I am a part-time broadcaster for
 and it is
 and basically operator engineer and run all the programming from satellite sources and a lot of programs
 what is my dream job good question probably
 similar to what I have in the Marine Corps I was a Sergeant Marine Corps had my own Squad so if I could have being in a management position where I have my own crew and take care of my own crew and look after their needs that would probably be my dream position
 it depends on the kind of mood I'm in sometimes I am I feel shy and just want to stay home other times I'm a little
 outgoing I want to go out with my friends and and go to dinner and have drinks and watch a sporting event
 why cuz I'm feeling good and I want to feel company of my friends and just want to talk and Converse
 how good relationship with my family my mother is like one of my best friends I have confide in her with basically all of my problems and good things my dad is is very good man we get along very well and I have three sisters that the two of them I see on a regular basis and one of them I really don't but we're all we're close family
 I know it's
 what do I do to relax
 is a my apartment complex I have a Jacuzzi so I spend 20 minutes in the jacuzzi and go for a swim afterwards or I will go on a bike ride I have my own mountain bike and I like to travel 5 miles then get to work out it so when I'm feeling since I go get a workout
 concussion I'm sometimes it's it's very hard but I have to look at myself in and limit myself on what the possible consequences of an uproar of my upper could could lead to so whether to be with my family or my co-workers I have to always look at my soft before I get very angry and and temperament that temperamental
 no I don't think so no
 a good question last time I got into argument
 was probably with my Dad we I go visit my parents and they have a pool and a pond trying to clean the pool we had a disagreement so we had an argument
 a situation where I wish I was at sea
 I was
 downsize from a full-time position back in December of 2012
 and I think I could have probably avoided it if I read the signs probably work a little harder and
 and probably
 I don't know
 I'm done a better job at that position
 something I feel guilty about
 ask a question I don't think I feel really guilty everything I have done I have
 lived up to you and not felt guilty about having wrong to anybody
 in particular
 and that not that I feel guilty I don't feel guilty about everything
 hardest decision I've ever had to make sure she probably when I was 17 years old sign a contract to join the Marine Corps and it was a six-year contract and
 I know that was probably a lot for my family but it's something I wanted to do but it was a really hard one and
 I made it and I live through it the six years and I think I am better for
 something I could have erased from my memory at sea
 let's see I'm trying to think
 probably
 I've got into to bar fights so probably limiting the alcohol use some of those some of those times and avoided trouble in the bars
 yes I have
 I was 18
 I wanted the toughest challenge for an 18 year old and I thought the and I knew that the Marine Corps would give it to me so I took it
 are you happy
 absolutely yes
 yes now I was in Desert Storm
 pretty easy to get used to growing my hair out again cuz I had it really short for 6 years and I really didn't like getting haircuts every week
 other than that I went too soon as I got out I went to broadcasting school and everything pretty much went back to normal
 I went to broadcasting school and then I I got a radio job in Palm Desert California and that was my first grader job but I don't know I work there for three months and I forgot a job in Riverside so after that I kept getting jobs and till now I've worked in radio for 22 years
 it changed me because I am more disciplined self this fund pay attention to detail more attention to detail than I ever have kind of a mental thing paying attention to detail but they drilled it into our heads
 pretty plainly I like to keep
 everything in its place and I like to keep ficked nobody taught me
 in general been feeling really well I've been exercising
 four times a week either swimming or bike riding and or both so I've been I've been feeling really well I can't complain
 I know I've always stated pretty even Keel and I like to like to keep it that way I don't like to get too low or get too high I like to stay stay even-keeled
 it is pretty pretty easy when I work out a lot but there are sometimes when I I do if I'm not a 5-mile bike ride and then I I I swim like 10 laps in the pool those days are easy for me to get a good night's sleep and some of the other days where I just do a bike ride or a swim but not both of those are pretty easy to sew
 sometimes I have too much energy but the
 but when I work out that energy yet I seem to have a good night sleep
 what am I like when I don't sleep well well I get up and I am really groggy and tired and I have to have at least three cups of coffee and that usually gives me the energy that I need for the whole day
 no I have never have
 I recently had a checkup from the from the VA and everything was was perfect so I'd I do not have PTSD
 again I am at my last physical I was asked if I was feeling depressed and I told him no and they did tests and determined that I wasn't wasn't a depressed person so I never feel depressed I always feel you killed it and never feel depressed
 the last time I felt really happy and well I'm a big sports fan so whenever sports teams do well especially the Dodgers which they have been doing really well lately keeps me happy and I like to see my favorite teams do well because I feel on the part of the team because I attend the games and support the team and I like to do like to see them succeed so basically it's baseball season right now but football season is around the Home Run basketball teams in the hockey season so epic sports fans to one of my teams do album I am I am feeling really really good
 somebody that's been a positive influence in my life I would say my parents they've been married since 1955 so I'm going up on almost 70 years 60 years 60 years so
 I think my parents my mom is a big influence and she's a very good woman and taught us to be very good people so I would say my parents
 my best friend describe me as determined
 driven
 and willing to succeed I would think
 something I did recently in which I really enjoyed let's see
 hide recently went
 toys for game with my boss and it was a couple weeks ago and we had really good seats from from the team and we had a great night. The food we had hot dogs and and french fries and the and the Dodgers won in the bottom of the night so it was a really really good game and it was a good experience
 most proud of being a marine serve six years in the Marine Corps around the Desert Storm veteran so Tuesday to the rank of Sergeant at the at 22 years old so I am grateful and most proud to be a United States Marine
 thank you
 we buy
