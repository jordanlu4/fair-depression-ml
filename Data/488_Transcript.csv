okay
yes
 fine
 San Fernando Valley
 I'll I really like the culture of going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around
 it's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and that have a good public transportation system
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot and that really like to go camping but I don't really travel
 I think I might have been around 6 months ago I went on a trip with a geology class
 yeah it was fun
 I think it's tough to say
 well I think the first time I went camping was probably really memorable I went to Death Valley and I got to see a lot of really cool things and hang out with my friends at night
 philosophy
 yes
 I don't know I think it just sort of happened I wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then I kind of grew disillusioned like that and I liked all the different ways are all different things I could do with philosophy
 I don't know but I really like children and I really like
 cutting their behavior so I think something along those lines might yet
 I think I'm generally pretty outgoing I can't be shy on my family but when I'm around friends and stuff I I think I'm pretty friendly
 I'm a lot of times I watch TV or read
 I think I'm pretty good I don't really get mad I try to think about other things if I start getting mad or I just started trying to focus on my breathing
 the last time I argue with someone else probably with my boyfriend and I'm having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was
 I think it was I wasn't feeling very well and I was having trouble deciding whether I wanted to go to his Department's end-of-year party and he was getting frustrated which I thought was very inconsiderate cuz I wasn't feeling well to begin with
 well I felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and I really hate when he gets stressed out or I gets angry easily because I just see necessary and it stresses me out
 I think a lot of times when my oldest youngest brother when my oldest little brother does something wrong I tend to be harsh with him we're not as close as my sister and I or my youngest brother and I and so he tends to be hostile back and I think that if I were little bit more gentle might be easier to communicate with him
 when I was 19 I came home
 travel party I think around 4 a.m. on a Sunday morning and my. Get really mad at me and yelled at me and said a lot of that very nice things and then he didn't speak to me for about a year
 I want my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that I don't live at home I used to be really frustrated with her all the time cuz she has a really quick temper but I think now that I've got a little bit more just so I can see that she does the best she could
 and I love my siblings I again my little sister and I get along really well she's 4 years younger than me and when
 when she was around 12 and I was around sixteen was really difficult cuz she a really harsh time for her and she was always Moody and I wasn't in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore and that's really great and
 we get along okay with my my older little brother who's 15 and I think I'm going along pretty well with my youngest brother who's 12
 one of the first not the first part one of my first Varsity professors and I really loved her classes and it was really good I'll being in class with a professor who really cared and who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that
 I think it's pretty easy I mean sometimes I have trouble going to sleep but I thought that it's I think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning
 well I'm really tired I can get grumpy but I think usually I'm just
 groggy
 good I'm a little anxious about
 about getting a job and I'm going to be taking for my school about it's only one class so a lot of free time
 well I mean it's not the end of the world if I don't get a job but I know that I will eventually so mostly I think I just try not to think about it too much and I tried not to be pessimistic
 no
 no
 well I think last time I felt really happy I
 went to a party with my boyfriend Matt and does apartment party and I wasn't you know I knew a couple people they are so I felt comfortable but I love that also able to meet new people there a couple kids there a special on the pool and a couple of drinks and ate some food and it was fun
 I'm sure probably say that I'm smart
 pretty intellectual I love to read and to watch
 really like series films and TV as you're probably all state on fun cuz we like to go out and have fun a lot
 well I can be really just organized and the packets me in trouble sometimes it will so that's a major loan then and procrastinating
 tell me about a time when someone
 I got into a little bit of trouble of few months back and have to go to court and was given 60 some hours of community service and of course I procrastinate and I'm doing that so I have to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was very mean and he didn't seem as she yelled at me but it didn't seem like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just a little less talk speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so I understand cuz that's his job but it was
 not great for me cuz I wasn't I was really anxious in that situation
 well I would have been 12 + 2
 I think
 I think I would have told myself at 12 not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents cuz I think I was a little selfish and self-involved II
 I can't really think of anything I regret how I treated my mother when I was a kid but everyone does that and I do regret a couple of semesters ago I didn't do so well in school and I got a few W switch I now have to work to get off on my transcripts
 I think so I am I think I wasn't focusing in school at that time and I didn't see any counselors at school or anything so I definitely couldn't find that
 I think I probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping on Saturday and then going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding and Jackson picking some oranges and then maybe going out to breakfast Sunday and just like window shopping
 maybe watching a little bit of TV
 well-met youngest brother is autistic and my mom and dad were always working when he was growing up I'm 10 years older than him so and being the only size of us took care of him which made me really really patient because he was a handful but I'm really proud of how she turned out and
 and how close we are
