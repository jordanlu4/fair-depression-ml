I'm going to bring this doorbell over here
 thank you
 are you okay with this yes
 I'm good thank you
 I was born in Mexico City
 yes
 I'm about 34 years ago
 yeah
 I tried to go back once a year but I haven't been in about 3 years
 I haven't had the time and I've traveled other places but I'm planning on going back probably next year
 okay
 how does it compare to LA
 well I can't ever see myself moving back to Mexico City it's a huge huge City and I like La more there's more opportunities and I just feel at home here
 my family moved here like I said I was very young and my parents moved to California to work and then we just stayed here
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer I love traveling I have not traveled as much as I would like to but I do love to travel
 just seeing these things meeting people from other countries to stop feeling relaxed and having no worries because you're on vacation I just love being in other places
 the last trip I took was a 7-Day cruise and it went to St Thomas Barbados St Lucia Dean Martin and it was amazing I would love to do that trip again
 I think going to Mexico the last time I was there I went to the pyramids still see what's going on and I had not been there in many years and it just was amazing to see the pyramids and I can't even imagine how they were able to build such great structures
 I consider myself more sigh
 in social situations I kind of feel uncomfortable I'm not one to just go up to people and start conversations if people come up to me of course I'll talk to them but I feel slightly awkward just kind of out of place at a party
 I actually studied history
 I've always been interested in history and I just wanted to learn about histories from other cultures and of course US history so I'm very interested history
 I'm actually working in the education field
 what's your dream job
 my dream job would actually be traveling around the world and having a show on like the Travel Channel that would be my dream job because I would get paid to travel and it's something I enjoy to do doing so I would love to do that as a job
 I love reading and I love taking baths so to relax I like to take a bath and I read while I'm in the bath and I also like going to the gym that helps me deal with stress and it actually relaxes me even though I'm exercising
 I used to be not very good at controlling it when I was a kid I would get mad very easily and sometimes as an adult I still get angry easily but I've gotten a lot better at trying to think about things first before saying them and not having outbursts things like that
 the last time I argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was my best friend and she actually she has kids lie down and for some reason she thought or thinks that I think I'm a better person than she is and because I went to school and she didn't and she's home with the kids and you know I'm able to do more things I don't think I've ever made her feel that I've been I definitely know I don't feel like I'm better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it
 tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle different
" well that's situation I wish I had handled differently because when she was talking to me she was very upset and I started off pretty
 I was angry at first but once we hung up I felt really bad about the situation I felt that maybe I could have just let her let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly instead of yelling at her to
 ever had
 oh wow
 that's a tough one I think
 cuz I think one of the hardest decisions I've had to make is breaking up with a boyfriend of 7 years although I knew that it was the right thing to do I was kind of hanging on to the fact that we have been together for so many years and I kind of felt by ending the relationship I would have wasted those last 7 years of my life so is a pretty tough decision to make but I realize that it was the best decision for me at the time and I'm actually glad I did because then I went on to meet my husband
 thank you
 about me bag or something that you wish you could erase from me
 well about I would say maybe
 15 years ago I was hanging out with a couple of friends at a club and they met some guys and they invited us back to their place and I really didn't want to go because I didn't know these people and I mean I knew their names and that's about it but my friends really wanted to go and I wasn't the one driving so I decided to just go along with them and back at their house one of the guys actually pulled me into a room and try I got scared I yelled he tried to choke me and I thought I was going to die right there right there and I was going to kill me but likely one of my friends knocked on the door because she heard me scream and we left so it could have been a worse situation but I still think about it and wish that I could erase it from my mind
 it was
 we have a pretty good relationship I am close to him I have a sister and a brother my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older and we got along pretty well my sister and I used to be best friends but then we grew apart and then and now we're actually closer I think than ever and I have a pretty good relationship with my parents my dad still treats me like I'm a little kid sometimes way to annoys me but I think we have a pretty good solid relationship
 how easy is it
 I usually wake up a few times throughout the night so I think it's rare for me to sleep the whole night through ever and I do feel a little like tired in the morning when I wake up it's hard I'm not a morning person definitely so yeah it's kind of hard to get a good night sleep
 I don't know I have a hard time falling asleep and then sometimes I have bad dreams or I need to get up to use the restroom but yeah I don't remember the last time I actually slept the whole night without waking up at least once
 emotionally good I'm actually on vacation right now from work so that's really nice physically I feel good I haven't been to the gym in a while so that kind of makes me feel bad cuz I like working out but health-wise I'm good
 no
 no
 it was a lot this past weekend I actually went out of town with my husband we didn't go very far we went to Santa Barbara but we really enjoyed ourselves we went wine tasting and went to the beach and just had a really good time
 how your best friend describe
 she would probably describe me as a good caring person patient very shy to place a 2 that I have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors cuz I'm always doing things for other people so yeah that's how I think she would describe me
 I wish I was more outgoing I wish that
 I what else definitely more outgoing so I could have more friends I don't have a large group of friends because I am very shy I also wish that I could have more patience than I do sometimes I'm very sorry to Paisans and I wish I could
 find a better job so I could do more traveling
 yes I actually took a really long time after high school to go back to school and get my degree and I really wish that I could have you know taking care of it a lot sooner than I did and I also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex-boyfriend
 advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago
 I would have told myself to stay focused on school that going out and hanging out and just you know going to parties was not as important as I thought it was and that my education should always come first
 I'm proud but after so many years of not being in school I was able to go to UCLA and get my degree yeah that would be my proudest achievement
 okay
 thank you
 bye
