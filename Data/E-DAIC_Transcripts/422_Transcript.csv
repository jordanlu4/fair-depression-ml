what is my hair doing over there so I see myself again
 it's a little better
 so this is mimicking her actual positions
 total ask someone to have a conversation kind of threw her
 okay thanks
 hi
 I'm not a therapist
 are you okay with this
 so how are you doing
 all right
 originally originally I'm from Korea
 I went out with a year old
 yes
 almost never ever been to Korea once
 I love the weather and being by the ocean and the culture has a lot of things to do with the food was a lot to like
 the traffic
 it seems like
 we're having a lot of economic difficulties in the parking tickets or super high sometimes I'm really annoyed by our government
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot
 fire shoes
 did he say buy your shoes
 your shoes aren't showing I have traveled a bit and sort of traveled I haven't traveled in a little bit in a little while
 oh just
 it
 it helps you keep things in perspective about our life here it's exciting and it makes me feel like I'm actually I'm really living cuz sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in LA and seeing other places you realize that you know life is about a lot of different things that you don't think about everyday
 well
 one of my trips I went
 I went to Singapore and then to Thailand and it was when I was with my ex-boyfriend and we went to
 he had he was a sales engineer for a systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this is kind of like a company thing so we went to Singapore for a few days and that was really interesting you know of course it's a lot different over there it's not just like going to Canada or something but they had a big reception in the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principles of company which is all fun and after Singapore we did some chores in Singapore this really isn't interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really it's not a lot of crime but the government is very is it's a little bit imposing but it was very interesting then we went to Thailand and that was almost as really completely different cuz like jungle we went to
 Phuket little island and it was just it was very primitive compared to Singapore just in a lot of different ways with her and just bring it was nice and everything was very cheap had a massage on the beach for $8 and it was interesting
 he has an hour for $8
 well I'm in school right now and I didn't I didn't finish school and I was younger because and
 had health problems
 so here I am I'm I'm just doing my General Ed right now I'm going to SMC
 yeah I'm happy
 call my dream job would be to be a veterinarian but I probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily ocelot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and and in a Veterinary capacity
 I think I'm right on the cusp it depends on the environment and the people I'm with and how comfortable I am but I'm really outgoing when I feel comfortable with people and I'll be really reserved if I'm not
 well I mean aside from sleeping
 I like like relaxing things like going for a bike ride on the Strand or if I'm at home I'll just like reading
 a lot of times I can just lay there and
 my mind might be doing things but I'm kind of relaxing
 I really good I don't have
 I would say there's certain things that
 they can really like make me
 like when I see Injustice has or things like that then
 I mean I can really feel it but I never just likes laugh a handle or throw things or even you know yell
 show me some arguments I mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument
 I would say last summer
 when
 I think it was after a baseball game there's a group of us and we went to
 we went to have shabu-shabu after the game and and I think
 and I know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like she's a good friend in some ways and she's a traffic kind of distant in other way so I don't consider her like someone that I would confide in and you know it was any problems but sometimes we just have she's very touchy and she's got the same sense of humor I do so I think she had said something to me during the night which kind of bother me but you know I just kind of
 that's just how she is and then I guess I said some things that she
 spell were
 I wish he gets really offended easily I think but after that we didn't talk for a while but then we then one day she called me up and then we're friends again
 but like she never has never confronted me
 ever had
 hardest decision
 it was leaving my ex-boyfriend
 how did you do
 well
 it wasn't
 it was a long time coming I mean I was thinking about it
 for like 5 years
 you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he's a really good guy but we just had a lot of
 we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements so I had thought about it and thought about it and
 we are already engaged but we've been together for a long time so
 I don't know
 I was always is always on my mind like should I get married or should I not and then finally we were just always having
 we're always went with the word I'm looking for
 we were just having these little snippy disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and I just decided that I was going to leave and I did
 it was really hard it was it was the hardest
 decision of my life and I can say that definitively
 and
 but I I think it was for the best
 who's probably leaving my job
 for well to help my friend start a business in Nevada
 and when I when I I really like my job I mean it was it was pretty good it was right over at the beach and when I told him that I was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me in a different position which is awesome
 and that was really stressful for me because
 I already promised my friends have to leave I would have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't
 for her wanting me to come over there it was really really stressful and I stress over it for about three weeks until I actually laughed and when I went over there
 like we had we had made agreements about how much they were going to pay me and blah blah blah when I got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that I needed a certain amount and the other principles of the company where you know it was a hard situation cuz she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much and also they were a different religion and it was very strange and they were all when I was I was surrounded by Mormons and I don't have anything against Mormons but it was very different because I was kind of an outsider there and then also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there so I would say that's when it's it's it's
 it just a pivotal point in my life and I think that
 I really wish I had just stayed
 well if you can erase something from my memory then I would probably say
 memory
 like really if if I could erase something from my memory what would I want to erase everything
 can we think of anything I mean
 even like that that bad decision that I made
 you know it has value in it so I can't really say that I would want something erasing maybe if I was like raped or something and it was really horrifying then I would but I don't
 well if your time about being in a deep sleep I'm in a deep sleep a lot but
 I never feel rested and that's it's a medical problem of mine
 can you tell me
 well I always feel like I haven't slept for two days and
 there are points in in the day
 I would say during some days are points in the day where I really feel alert and alive and and rested but their short-lived
 but I sleep a lot I sleep
 pretty crappy physically pretty crappy
 no thanks
 now
 I haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but
 that's that's usually what doctors
 like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed I'm I'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but that's the first thing that they try and
 figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep
 but I do
 I do
 I would say I feel down sometimes
 my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down I would say that I do feel down sometimes a lot of time but it's not
 I would say is reasonable considering the situation that I'm in
 okay
 I need triggered by something
 they're just triggered by Tech that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult but
 I wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular
 oh there I mean
 I mean for a long. Of time or every night I experience happiness like when I go out with friends or I go and you know I've
 find some great new dish I like I mean
 what type of Happiness are you looking for
 well
 I mean right now
 my friend just had surgery and so I'm staying with her this week I'm really enjoying it I mean even though we could never live together I can never live with live with her long-term and I'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but I'm having fun and
 you know she just she installed the Groupon app on her on her phone yesterday cuz she's been paying too much for laser hair removal installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her as a Groupon deal so I mean you know there's a little fun things like that
 how your best friend are you
 probably
 OCD
 and
 probably thinks I'm pretty prissy compared to her
 I think that she would
 say that have a good heart or very different
 it probably that I am
 I should ask her
 I know we go out so I think she say that I'm fun
 but she has mentioned that I'm I'm a very private person and that I know I've I knew before she said that
 why
 I have what I told you I have I have a lot of problems right now
 and
 so I don't really
 tell people about them
 it is kind of a kind of a killjoy but also
 people can feel I feel that people can feel less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of
 it's just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help her they feel guilty but they have busy lives so it's kind of traits of gaap but I would say even before even before this difficult time in my life I've been
 I put a private person I don't know why
 I think a lot and I'm a deep thinker
 and
 maybe it's a
 you know it
 not like I feel like I feel abnormal but maybe I just have a lot of thoughts that don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or not sure
 well one thing that I regret right now is
 yeah I haven't really found
 somebody
 you got to spend the rest of my life with so I would tell myself to concentrate more on that cuz once you hit 40 it's it's it's a lot harder
 I would say
 that I persevered I'm very proud that
 even though I have a lot of
 difficulties in my life
 the fact that I'm a male making this commitment to go to school and I'm doing it on my own
 and
 you know it's
 it's kind of a
 if people if people knew all the problems today have they be like well you know why are you worried about school but
 I really feel that
 you know I'm I'm doing this and I'm really proud that even through everything and getting a raise
 okay thanks
 hi
