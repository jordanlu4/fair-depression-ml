hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today
are you okay with this yes
 I'm doing well
 California
 I like the weather I like the people
 I don't like the traffic that's primarily it
 sociology
 it's a topic that just really interested me the most out of all the other subjects
 now
 to be a writer
 can you tell me about
 I like being able to write what I want to write right now I write things that I'm not really that interested in
 like what like articles about a teenager culture stuff like that
 I think they have it pretty easy and I know how easy they have it
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot at no not really
 okay
 you can see yourself more shy
 depends on the situation or who I'm around when I first meet people I can be shy but if it's someone I've known for a while I can be that guy
 I'll lay down or try some shirt like deep breathing or just maybe do something that's kind of fun in my numbing like watch TV
 I'm pretty good I don't really let anger show that much I'm not like that I don't have a fiery temper or anything like that I'm pretty rational
 when was the
 I actually can't remember when the last time I argued with someone was cuz it's been so long
 what's something you feel guilty about
 because I feel guilty about the fact that I don't talk to my grandparents as much as I should
 I'm close with my grandparents but not really anyone else in my family
 cuz they basically serve raised me and my parents weren't really in the picture that much
 I can't really think of one
 right now
 I guess when my sister died it was really traumatizing
 yeah yes
 is the hardest decision I've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband
 what made you decide to do that because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married but I still felt like I should stick it out
 how hard is that
 I mean it was hard at the time but I made the right decision I think
 my grandmother was a positive influence from a young age
 can you tell me about that
 she's just a very strong powerful through staunch character that rubbed off on me
 so good
 how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep not really super easy
 I sort of I mean it's probably my fault I go to bed too late
 just heard a foggy and distracted and trouble concentrating
 okay
 how did the feeling lately
 you mean like my body
 normal fine no complaints
 and same as ever
 no
 last night I was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff
 how would your best friend describe
 probably funny and easy to get along with but also caring
 bunny radio
 I spend my ideal weekend not really doing much like maybe just sitting around reading or going to the movies watching TV
 is everything your
 no I don't think there's that I don't think I think regretting things is a waste of time
 advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago
 don't try to
 don't go out of your way to try and press people if they like you than they like you
 what are some things you wish you could change about your
 sometimes
 sometimes I can be kind of lazy
 I'd like to have more of a laxative
 better work ethic I guess
 it just sort of putting off stuff until you know right when it's due or after its do things like that procrastinating
 okay
 tell me about a time when someone made
 sometimes for the things that I write people will write negative things about me like in the comment section on a website that'll make me feel bad
 I'm articulate and funny and a good friend
 I guess I'm most proud of the fact that
 I
 and satisfied with myself and my friends and my status in the world
 I'm proud of the fact that I feel comfortable with it
 I'm just hanging out with my friends for people watching watching a movie that's good listening to music
