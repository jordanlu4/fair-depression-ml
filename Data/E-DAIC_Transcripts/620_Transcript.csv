 okay
 so I'll be looking at that image
 your field of psychology
 okay
 and you are at USC
 Lincoln City
 oh okay my cousin went Upstate but Cornell he has a beautiful waterfalls blah blah blah
 yeah
 he was he was the lawyer for the deposed Governor Patterson of New York
 yeah
 never have them please
 she got her hair done all that gets
 why doesn't she face me more
 she's at an angle which is okay but I'm just going to just observe
 yeah the cavalry
 this internet radio show
 I've been doing it for 6 weeks and the technology failed us every time except the last time
 thanks
 looks the same to me
 oh got it I said
 sure
 Bergen Record
 are you running three or four rooms at the same time
 yeah
 yeah
 yeps
 it's a good today
 I'm a native of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania
 shellac of snow
 the weather is good
 and it's a more open
 free liberal place
 I am extremely happy to be in La I'm extremely happy to be not on the East Coast so I'm going to say that I have no complaints
 I pretty much live in a village and my Village is a couple square miles and
 I meet all my needs close by
 I travel by bicycle and I enjoy the fitness that I drive
 I have the same trip everyday jump on the bike by Sunset Strip roll to my downhill to the farmer's market for lunch tell three more miles uphill to the post office and shopping and roll down Sunset back home again
 well they're all pretty good
 I used to attend the Little League World Series and that was a memorable experience
 English lit
 I have involved in politics and writing and I just launched an internet radio show
 it might be reasonable to say that I have that dream job right now in terms of I'm fully immersed in the media and I have an outlet
 I'm a pretty perfect combination of both but I'm not going as a public persona
 well it is necessary to be out going to communicate to persuade to function in society and to entertain and to have Lively up friendships
 I'm the oldest of nine we're in pretty good shape I talk to my brother John each week my sister Mary each week my sister Patty each week my sister Dolores every couple weeks so what we're in pretty good shape
 Isaiah
 watch MSNBC I watched all of them any of the political shows
 I read I'm on the internet
 but I would say that I'm okay if controlling my temper I I don't have fights and I've never had any trouble with the law so perhaps I'm doing something right
 that was a non sequitur
 oh I had a minor disagreement with my brother last night just about
 the Dynamics of the radio show and the concept of a permanent co-host versus rotating guest hosts and we each look at it differently and I really didn't fight with him I let him have his opinion
 nothing really leaps to mind I am old enough that I
 by and large learn to how to cope
 not being president of the United States
 well that's the hardest decision I ever made was the easiest decision I ever made which was leaving the confines of the East Coast traveling 3000 Miles without family or friends because it was important to do for to fulfill myself
 you know it's hard to respond to that because even negative images and experiences I learn from you know I'm going to be philosophical and say I'm happy for
 all my experiences and I'm happy for all my scars
 yes
 I was 21 when I joined the military
 it was not much of a decision that was essentially a forced on me and others we had a draft at that time
 I am now
 did I see combat we were rocketed and I was never a med Evac hospital I've seen
 combat images I've seen
 mangled people coming in off the helicopters
 don't know I went back to civilian life I worked a job and went to school and function
 I came home to Pennsylvania finished my college and and then moved to California
 I didn't quite hear that one how did the military treat me fairly and I got to the benefit of the GI bill for my education and I currently have the medical benefit of the VA so I suppose the deal worked out favorably for each of us
 a pretty good optimistic fit
 I'm getting more done being more productive and more fulfilled lately
 I sleep no problemo
 I sleep just fine no problem
 when I typically do sleep well if I don't get enough sleep it impacts my day of course
 no I have not been I have not
 I have not been diagnosed with depression
 I felt really happy on Sunday having achieved a radio program and I got on the internet and shared it with my friends
 let us say
 people who impacted by my youth
 gave me my first job and radio and up to with a wonderful thing
 you might have to ask him I think people find me pretty upbeat cheerful enthusiastic they certainly would say smart
 yesterday I had a wonderful
 10 mile bike ride in the Heat and I'm happy that I'm physically able to do that
 that I have survived the most proud that I've survived all manner of dangers
 and I have endured I have persevered I'll even be bold enough to say that I have a Triumph
 it's been a joy
 goodbye
