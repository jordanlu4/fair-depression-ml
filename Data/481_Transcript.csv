can't you see me right now
 okay
 hello
 yeah I am
 good to moderate
 Los Angeles
 yeah I'm from
 just a lot of different kinds of people and I love the weather most of the time and great creative seeing I'm really into music so it's a great scene for that
 I don't like driving I don't know who does right it's just it's just such a drag and getting from point A to point B is just the daily need and it doesn't get any easier too many people too many people
 can't see your shoes
 yeah when I can I want when I can afford to
 being somewhere else not having to drive usually must places have better public transportation just mean I'm a culture junkie I like experiencing different types of cultures so that's
 how many places I've been to like Mexico and Italy it it's I want to go to more places I want to go to Japan
 so that'll be interesting and usually this is my family my mom sometimes my girlfriend sometimes my brother and we just yeah we go to Italy we spent two weeks there though I was cool
 yeah
 living next to the best gelato shop in Italy
 we were we were in Florence spent a spend a week in Florence that was great big very good culture there as well
 art
 studied film and digital media cuz I make music and I want to learn how to make music videos so it's someone trying to get into
 yeah yeah I mean I need to get a camera that's the thing but I've been with my main focus is music I studied film but my focus is music
 can you tell me about
 sure I've been playing music and playing guitar keyboard bass drums for about 12 years now and I do production and songwriting an indie rock band
 that's a great website I highly recommend it and it's it's mine so
 Shake It Up
 International Rockstar music producer and filmmaker director
 probably are going
 I'm just feel like it's the way to get the most out of life talking to people and learning about them and having them learn about you and care about you it's a territory
 yeah
 I do meditation
 and
 it's not really hard cuz it's fun and it it relaxes me and helps me Focus the same time
 which I know that that was a huge Epiphany for me that you can relax and focus at the same time cuz they're only when I'm relaxing I'm tuning out I'm focusing on something else but to be able to come by in the sensations was yeah I've been doing that for about 3 months now so
 yeah it is
 almost to get a tax sometimes others things that should be said that I that I don't just because you know it's like you're opening up a can of worms maybe one of your friends for example I got a problem with him but they don't have a problem with him necessarily so you can do anything to them and I've had to deal with that in the past sort of a awkward social situation but
 yeah I make deal
 probably argued with the guitarist for my band we had a falling-out we're not going to be in a band together and we're still friends so at least it's that but it was just basically about creative control the project and how we're going to prioritize it and in our lives and
 you know we just our priorities weren't the same and I got very upset so that was the end of that
 I felt good that it was definitive that it was no choice has been made on both parties also regretful that you know he didn't feel the way that I want him to feel about it which was excited about the project so
 the fact that he wasn't really in it kind of pissed me off but I got over it any I got some other people that are really really excited to be working with me even honored so you know I'm gone
 thank you
 I don't know I don't really I don't really have any regrets like that at the moment I can't really think of any
 when I was in high school I cheated on my girlfriend I don't think it would mean anything it's time
 but I did it
 I regret it but I
 you know you know life happens you make some mistakes
 selfishness
 being young and thinking it would matter
 you know
 thinking
 you know you only live once and
 you know for me it's probably for the best ultimately cuz you know I love my current girlfriend and I would never do that to her so
 that was that was years ago but and she was a nice girl she didn't deserve that so
 I got it
 shit genzyme
 I guess whether to go to college or not cuz I had some projects going in La that I didn't really want to shut off a dab and going get a manager we were playing out a lot and I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep that going or go to school and start over and I made the decision to go to school in Santa Cruz and and start a new life there for four years and
 it was difficult decision but I'm glad I did send that a lot of people a lot of people I'm still close with today that and we work on stuff together and all that so good
 I agree that is good thank you
 maybe I wish I could forget getting spanked in the parking lot when I was 4 by Danish babysitter you know on the abuse scale it's pretty low but it was somewhat humiliating and I I don't forget so
 have a pretty vivid picture of it and
 I'd be happier if it wasn't there
" positive there a sportive give me a hard time sometimes because they don't think that I keep things in perspective and terms of
 creative projects that I make so
 yeah there's a bit of tension there just cuz they expect certain things from me and I expect them as well but I just have a different way of going about it than they might prefer
 but they're sweet people
 how do I cope with them I do know what they're lovely people at their core you know cope with them cuz I love them I just
 no X I'll just go off on my own for a while
 and you know take a breather or whatever and they have everyone makes you mad sometimes so
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 challenging
 I just I try doesn't work
 sometimes I have to take medication for it at to take Ambien something like that
 I'm someone who sleeps in late so I always get at least six or seven hours if I have to wake up early for something I get nauseous sometimes I'll throw up in the morning yeah I've had jobs where I wake up and
 you know vomit while I'm brushing my teeth it's horrible
 it does suck its kind of something I'm worried about you know I kind of need to get some part-time work while I'm not you know getting a steady payflow for my music production so
 yeah it's pretty rough
 got some stuff I need to get over I'm not really sure how
 just not feeling good getting nervous when you know there's something stressful like a stressful work environment or just something that it doesn't sit well with me like being in a
 yeah I rushed and you know stressful work environment just unless it's about something that I care about you no like music or the Arts it's just very hard to give a shit frankly like and you know I try to psych myself into giving a shit and it just makes me sick you know maybe I'll have a Red Bull or something and your body doesn't want that in the morning it just like my body rejects things and
 yeah
 okay
 I've been feeling okay
 very very reflective for contemplative now there's going to be some changes and it's going to be
 some new people in my life some new people in my band and I'm going to try to push myself but try to stay grounded at the same time cuz you know I expect more for myself it's just pissing me off when I get mad at me. Basically feel like I'm shiting all over myself my body sitting on me anyway just by being so so
 shity
 yeah
 no
 yes
 I was diagnosed
 12 years ago I haven't been in therapy since
 they gave me Zoloft and I don't like it
 made me feel worse than I do in the shittiest moments I was telling you about it it made me feel numb
 I don't want to feel numb I want to feel everything even if it sucks
 being forced to
 this private school they thought I was acting up I thought I was up at a kid I think I was just being a kid so
 yes I do
 well I haven't been in in 12 years but I do think that it might be helpful for me in the future
 can you tell me about that
 I thought you weren't a therapist that's a typical therapist question right there
 well yeah
 I kind of want to go back to therapy and might help might help me buy some solutions maybe maybe it's not a therapist any maybe it's a life coach I have no idea but
 I'll be seeking help soon
 yesterday
 I was watching a movie with my girlfriend and I looked over at her and smiled at each other and it was great
 yeah
 very honest
 sometimes brutally so but I'm a good guy I think they're my friends all think I'm a gay guy funny
 open minded
 I guess that's what I'm working on which is trying to improve my discipline and try to work through
 my body rejecting shittiness of the world
 it gets better
 stay in shape gets harder the longer you wait
 give up on your dreams keep doing what you're doing
 my music
 you're welcome miss talking to you
