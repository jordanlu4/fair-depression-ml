 I guess around here I don't travel from state-to-state I don't have that type of money yet
 seeing the scenery meeting different people saying you know there are different states and how their bill you know the housing and no different structures like that
 I'd like to hear about
 well Braxton's when I went to Virginia when I was in the service
 I like to going to Petersburg and Richmond it was nice there the people in The Shopping Bag then in those days things were a lot cheaper
 hey you buy things at a reasonable price the economy was smell down there and
 everything was reasonable
 I enjoyed being on the Army grounds when I was in Virginia. I really enjoy that
 one of my major studies was mathematics
 I was real good at math
 besides other general you know that general education but math was one of my stronger subjects
 what are you doing now
 I've just started to go to college today today was my first day I'm studying computers and designing
 I'm going to see what I can do what designer from their computers I wanted to learn computer so I can have my own computer at home and you know surf the web and the internet and all that
 what's your dream job

 you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
 I'm outgoing person
 I have a good relationship with my family is for my mother and sisters and have Uncle left you know my cousin's we all we all get along good everybody lives in life you know we have a tendency to you know staying ourselves and get together every now and then you know when it's time for us to get together family reunions and things like that
 sometimes when I'm feeling 10
 I know it's not Hawaii
 watch a lot of Television I like westerns in different movies like that talk to a lady friends
 things like that
 very good
 real good at controlling my temper
 Gap Tennessee to take a lot and then you know
 something bothers me. Something that happened in the past and you know I get some alcohol at me and kind of you know I had to get that out you know
 key from exploding
 and I busted something you know
 when was the last time
 Target about cleaning up the barracks the shelter that I'm in now
 Jeff
 a serviceman that are in the Bears and they don't want to clean up behind ourselves then it got in a big argument with one of the
 ask one of the veterans about that
 well
 I kind of
 had it out with one of the staff members there ain't always says something behind my back so I had to let him know
 where I stood at in and what he shouldn't have said I wish I would have said the words that I said to him but
 what's done is done so I can't take that back
 okay
 what's something you feel guilty about
 I have a lot of things I feel guilty about five things I've done in the past that I wish I hadn't done
 but
 I can't change the past
 so I have to live for today
 well that's that's how
 I had to make a lot of hard decisions but I can tell you one that I had to make my nephew was living with me what you thought it was going to be able to stay with me for over a. Of time and I had no let him go tell him that you know you stopped you to go you have to man up and do what you have to do for yourself
 okay
 tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from me
 although whole lot of things I wish I could erase my memory
 one thing I
 Sam being whipped for the extension cord the website on my body and
 a tattoo on my left forearm
 that's going to be there in until I die or have it removed
 man it is show so it's got to be there
 have you ever served in the military yes
 yes I have
 19
 I grew up yes yes I'm happy I did I had grew up and become you know a young man it was time for me to get out and start making my own way for myself
 did you ever see
 no no I just got in at the end of the Vietnam War which I try to go in while I was still happening but I was too young and it will let me go in
 how easy was it for you to go
 I really didn't have that much of a problem adjusting to it but I really missed being in the military you know as far as being an active-duty I wish I would have stayed in there instead of coming back
 home so quick
 you know but Bobby being married I came back to my wife and
 my marriage didn't last long song
 and miss me up
 so I just had to spin the wheels for a while
 went to work
 I worked at the Naval Shipyard I worked as a mechanic and I work doing construction work
 and also Parks and Recreation
 what a gave me a different outlook on life
 as far as the things that I was doing as a Young Man
 I just turn me just completely around backwards go to the way you know do things right in my life instead of what I was doing hanging out in the streets drinking
 no way my friends and stuff like that so that was a really big help for me
 living life on life's terms if that's a good enough answer living life on life's terms trying to make it day by day and stay out of the way
 stay out of Harm's Way
 not really
 not that I can think of right off the top of my head no
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 sometimes it varies I'm a getting old
 three door four nights okay and then other nights I'm up and anxious waiting to go and do what I have to do the following day and and sometimes I just don't sleep I had to get up and watch television drink coffee and smoke cigarettes and think
 isomalt
 it's some form but I didn't follow through with it you know you want to give me all the different medications and things like that I took some of her then I stop cuz you're putting me in a whole different different atmosphere
 and I didn't know what brand I have left I want to keep it and use it
 probably like five years but more of an event like that last year pass
 same different psychiatrist
 guess more of
 more of depression and my surroundings
 the area that I was living in
 play a big part of that
 well when you live around people that you know are in gangs and stuff and shooting shooting up and down the street all the time and you see four five six people get killed within a 3-mile. On your street I mean that's it is heartbreaking your your heart goes out to them people
 you know when you see these people go up and down the street every day and you don't know who's who and what's what so some you have to live with me have to be on your guard at all times
 how do you cope with them
 passing by
 wave keep going about your business
 can you tell me about that
 well I really don't have her answer for because a lot of times you don't conversate with those type of people you just Pastor buys
" see
 had got depressed and start using alcohol and drugs
 and you know what to change my environment and also changed myself so I needed to take myself out of that situation and put myself in a different environment and start over again
 you still go to therapy now
 I know I don't know I haven't been I haven't been to therapy since
 April of this year
 and that was in a group setting
 yes it is
 if you use the materials are the tools that they give you say it's very useful
 well Frances if somebody give you some advice
 to not do it a certain thing
 and you do that certain thing was said I warned you not to do that then you're going to kick your own self in the behind so it'd be better if you
 take the advice and not do that thing and you are you know the results and a lot of times you have traveled down that road before it's no good for you so dad in
 well been utilizing some of the material that they've given me
 and I'll set up keep going on the roller coaster ride and I'll just leave that little part of life alone and live life on life's terms
 okay
 when is the last time
 wow it's been a long long time since I
 really really felt happy it's been a long time I couldn't answer that question for you
 I mean
 I couldn't Odysseus spend years
 for me repeat the question

 a real inspiration to me
