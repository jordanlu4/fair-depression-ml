 you travel a lot I like to whenever I can I'm a big fan of traveling
 visiting new places meeting other people eating different food seeing other cultures that kind of stuff
 I went to Spain recently and that's a little bit of a more laid-back lifestyle they don't work the same hours As Americans different culture they take a lot of breaks rests during the middle of the day especially in the summer when it's really hot totally different food style culture they go out to bars and restaurants a lot later stays open later and you know something new exciting and you know I look forward to seeing other types of destinations like that
 going to Spain with the all my old high school friends I hadn't seen them in a while and we did a big tour of Spain went to Madrid Barcelona Valencia had a great time you know spent a couple weeks out there and
 I am catch a relaxing and have fun
 how is a computer science major
 you know I do it Consulting
 dream job probably I want to I want to start moving into Finance I want to do something financial-related investment-banking I think I'm going to switch course pretty soon here
 I'm a little bit more shy
 my family is good we're a little bit closed we don't we don't show a lot of emotion and we're not is as loving you know over the phone or in person but you know we have other ways to show our emotions
 yeah
 I usually I'll just watch a movie or go to the movies go to the park I have a small dog so I like taking him around the block so that they usually relaxes me a bit
 how are you
 I'm usually pretty good I don't really get extremely angry very often and I keep a lot of my emotions inside which isn't always good but you know I never have crazy angry outbursts and get violent or anything like that
 when was the last
 the last time I argued with someone was a few weeks ago we are actually in Las Vegas and you know we were with a big group of people and we are just trying to decide where to go and one of my friends was pretty adamant about one place and it was unappealing to the rest of the group so you know I got a little confrontational but everything worked out in the end
 tell me about
 I think the passing of my my mom's dad I wish I would have been a little more loving and an emotional to my mom about it you know it was a very difficult time for her friend
 I should have been there a little bit more than I was
 I feel guilty about just not being as as loving and caring to my parents I mean they've they've done a lot for me and provided a lot and I don't know he's really show my appreciation to them I think as much as I wish I should so
 tell me about the hardest decision
 the hardest decision I ever
 something that I wish was erased would certainly be when I was pulled over for a DUI very embarrassing moment but you know I wish that it never happened
 have you ever seen
 how have you been feeling lately
 I've been a little bit sad I had another death in the family recently my uncle passed away a couple weeks ago so it's been a little bit difficult on all of us and you know we're all spread out around the country so it's
 stuff we can't really you know be together in person so
 makes it difficult
 how do you notice
 I just recently I mean I think I've been a little a little more bummed out and
 you know down a little bit more than you know normal so you know I'm sure it'll turn around soon but some of these things just take time to heal
 tell me more about that
 well you know whenever you lose someone close to you in a family you know it's very difficult for everyone and the you know different people show their emotions differently so you know for me I tend to keep a lot of it in and then I'll be a little more beneficial if I was able to express it to someone more but you know I don't really feel comfortable doing that all the time so
 hopefully things get better
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep it's very difficult cuz I work a lot of strange hours to so I'm up in a working late and then got to get up early and sometimes I can sleep in more so you know if I'm not in a set routine it makes it a little more difficult but you know I usually get a decent amount of sleep as often as possible so I usually don't have too much trouble in that sense
 what are you
 fell asleep while I'm usually a little just bit more irritable more grumpy you know smaller things can set me off a little bit but you know I have certain techniques to relax a little bit more so you know whenever that happens I'm I'm usually able to handle myself appropriately
 have you ever been diagnosed with
 no
 no
 when is the last time
 the last time was probably about three weeks ago when I was in Las Vegas visiting some friends and had some other friends come out to visit that I hadn't seen in a while so that was a fun happy time for the weekend
 my dad is always been you know of a good role model to me professional and you know I always been there regardless of what I've been going through so I certainly look up to him and appreciate everything he's done for me
 he would describe me as being pretty social outgoing but a little bit more shy and reserved so you know friendly caring honest and unreliable
 great
 what's something you did
 something that I recently did that they enjoyed was completing a big project for someone I built a large website that have been a big project for a while and it's been taking up a lot of my time so finally getting that finished and taken care of was a big relief and weight off my shoulders
 nice
 what are you most proud of in your life
 most proud of my family they've always been there for me I've gone through a lot of tough times when I was younger and you know they've always been there to support me and that's really meant a lot so that's really kept me going yeah I've got great friends around me as well but he'll family first and you know they've always been there when I needed them
 thanks for sharing your thoughts
 are you
