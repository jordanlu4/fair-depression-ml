 I like the weather I like the sports teams like the entertainment
 it's pretty much the same you're wrong as far as the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get to get all four seasons so it's kind of like a mixed bag and I guess that means I'm kind of used to it by now so be nice to explore other areas I will draw my life having too much traveling so it's a little bit of a kind of a Readiness to it but overall it's okay
 okay
 I like the computer programming and operations but that's going back to the 70 so it's technology has changed a lot as you can tell the last 40 years that's right that's why I chose my major yeah
 I know it's kind of this kind of inquisitive it to get to use your mind you was like your brand-new something you know very novel back in the in the old days you know I'm back in the seventies now it's turned into computers but back then I was sort of like something very unique you didn't see too many computers around back then and then programming so it's kind of been to the logical together solving a particular problem he'll come up with a step-by-step Solutions on I guess I'll sort of the analytical Ennis of the year the problem
 I know I kind of FaceTime still use computers but I haven't gotten I've been have been in programming for a long time
 well I kind of got into an another area kind of divorce Intuit diversion to another area my life this is going back to the late 70s I kind of took another turn and then by the time I got back into it was I kind of got into another field so I never really pursued it to the degree that I wanted to
 what's your dream job wow that's a good question I never thought about that ironically actually pretty simple this point in time this is kind of like a little bit depressed and then I am at this point it kind of just wanted to kind of just do a nice relaxing job but I do want it somewhat of a challenge but I don't want to have to like do too much too much thinking it's almost said what I was back in the in the old days you know I just want a nice comfortable relaxing job but I can feel fulfillment on but I don't want to chance of a situation kind of point in my life I just want a nice relaxing job
 yeah
 oh I would say well the most part shot because once I get going I could be outgoing but I'm shy to begin with and then I X I can listen up and be more outgoing and spend I can take it to the extreme arm talking too much like once upon gates open at the kind of open up too much so I have to like back off now but overall it's a I'm kind of shy as it is a general demeanor
 okay
 sometime
 turn on the fish tank screensaver
 yeah
 well I listen to music by watch TV
 just was what it would do to relax a stressful situation so I can have them stay relaxed Elsa talk to my friends to I'll be around an area about kind of a comfort area where I feel safe I can just dialogue with people so kind of gets me out of my think about my own problems I'm having a kind of just you know focus on being in the moment with my friends and acquaintances
 I'm pretty good I don't really have a temper problem it takes a lot to get me to to explode I think when I was in my younger days I think it was a bit more
 had a little bit slight bit of Tampa never had a really bad temper but tempers not really an issue I have to be pretty mellow easy-going
 wow that's a good question I'm not sure to be honest
 I don't think about that for a long time and to be honest I can't come with an answer on that not really part of my repertoire nothing comes to mind. My head
 well
 well don't say anything on the way back and made some bad and bad Investments back about 10 years ago
 how's more
 Charlie like what I'm looking for more trusting of people like that people in like them I thought were expert in their field and I inherited some money I was little bit careless with it and I just kind of had a Vibe you know that nothing would go wrong kind of little bit of night-night tivity and unfortunately some bad financial decision is kind of put me in a bad position for the rest of my life and fortunately he got because of a medical conditions I have talking to rebounding you don't make it all up so I was saved mainly financial and investment decisions that I really regret
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to me
 wow
 that's a tough one
 I can't think everything about my head
 okay
 well I don't really have too much family left the only one I have is my it just me and my uncle and we could we communicate on a regular basis he look but he lives in Clearwater Florida so long we were okay but
 he's like it isn't he's in his eighties and I was young my my 50 so we can we do we have kind of small talk and he's kind of concerned about my well-being but it's kind of somewhat of a on a shell of a really deep and that he's got his own problems so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation
 other than him it's really there's not really anybody else to have I did that part makes me a little depressed cuz I don't really feel I have anybody I can really count on a really confide in
 it is challenging I don't know why but I do have a medical condition something that might be part of the problem and I have a little bit of BPH so I'll be out of town for the restroom and answer your question to make a long story short it is challenging to get a good night's wake up feeling a little bit tired aching but it is difficult
 how deep is feeling lately
 well I've been feeling okay I mean
 be kind of feeling now actually trying to address issues that I haven't taken responsibility for
 but I feel a bit of calmness as of late
 have you ever been tagged
 no
 well I just say yes. The questionnaire and I'm not positive if it was technically diagnosed with it I did take a Venus call the mmph the Minnesota multi-faceted personality something of whether this is going back about six months ago they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got two questions about my my well being psychologically too and I think some of the answers to the advice that I see a psychologist or psychiatrist I didn't follow that up on that because the philosophical differences but I think I might have a mild case of depression
 well you don't like I said I'm just kind of like kind of goat along in life and I'm doing okay but you know highlights passed me by so I haven't really fulfilled my my goal was kind of like alone I'd like to have a girlfriend I don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of tell me who I feel I can get close to and I'm not really in my life right now so what is a certainty I'm having some kind of financial uncertainties so overall not doing as good as I'd like to
 okay
 tell me about the last time you felt really happy
 that's a good one really happy
 let me think about that a minute
 well actually it wasn't that long ago actually I want you
 okay I know that one actually I think I'm going to answer I hope that old lady she was at a trade show it was a Anaheim with natural products Expo so it's pretty nice we we had some nice meals afterwards there's a lot of exhibitors giving out really nice samples it was an Anaheim some kind of got a chance to get away from LA and
 met some interesting people are they were very outgoing they're willing to like having experienced their product or service and I was around people that I work with who I got to socialize with old was pretty happy back then and it was about a month ago
 yeah that was
 best friend and I really have a best friend but
 I would say
 I don't know technically I really don't have a best friend so she heard me answer that so I can't really come with an answer to be honest
 I like to be conscientious and I do have flaws Mary but I think the overall unconscientious I try to be honest for the most part I'm on the major issues I might you know they would have likewise or you know I'm not perfect I'm not going to come to the serious stuff I tend to be pretty honest I'm a hard worker. Good work ethic
 can you be pretty calm for the most part
 play regret
 what can you elaborate on that
 well
 I just well just overall I regret them
 not be a little more assertive in my earlier
 earlier life if I put myself in this position is going to go back to my financial decisions that was sort of that sort of like my albatross in my life I made some bad decisions and unfortunately the kind of pay the price for now so I kind of like sort of like living sort of a popper existence right now which is kind of kind of depressing so I would say that's part of what I regret most of all
 advice would you give yourself 10
 well I would say to really you don't analyze kind of go with what you really feel
 I think I was going with other people's opinion other people's advice I was kind of going away from my basic beingness you don't like the way I really felt like I'd make you aggressive investing which if it turned out good it would be like for like when the lot I would have been well off for the rest of my life but unfortunately it went the opposite way too many eggs in a basket so I kind of regret it going with my gut feeling and let other people influence me and I could by Nature I'm a conservative person so I should really do more conservative Investments another is my life at 10 to be more conservative but I kind of made some aggressive financial decision so that's pretty much
 can a local doctor that area as far as what I regret
 wow
 that's interesting I've been doing a lot of working weekends so well I do like to be profitable to do something where I can actually you don't make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time could you trade shows but I'm not doing that then I'm like maybe watch some men you know I like to go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game go to a movie go with some friends so just going to kick back but my main primary primary focus will be on earning earning money on the weekends
 huh
 that's interesting
 what's prerogative
 I would say that I live by and large all of the wholesome life I would say I never got myself into any kind of really bad
 bad advice you know I
 I love the pretty hoe salsa my wife I said I'll probably I don't really proud but as far as I stay the course as far as not going down any real deep to speak
 okay
 my pleasure
 that's pretty interesting is it improve your technology on a lot more like you're talking to a live person Siri
 it was kind of a little bit more Academy can tell us like a more like a like a video game this looks more like a real person communicates like
 return for not trying to deal with her but it was some other guys and I think I know what it was but it was a little bit more
 I can't reveal all the details but this is see no more comfortable more natural
 yeah
