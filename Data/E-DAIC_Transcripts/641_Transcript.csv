 I feel guilty about the things that I have to do to
 get ahead of other people sometimes
 the hardest decision I've ever had to make was to
 go into the military

 I was in a really bad relationship and I wish I could forget it because I think it causes a lot of problems for me cuz I always remember it

 because I was broke and I needed money for school and yes

 nervous and depressed and not happy
 have you noticed any changes
