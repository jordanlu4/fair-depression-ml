 I work in the entertainment business so I had to be out here
 it was pretty easy because I live in New York first and if you can survive New York you can survive la
 things you really like
 the weather of course beaches people are much router in me than what I'm used to but I like it
 a graphic design media arts
 in High School I was ahead and all my classes and credits so I had to take a college course so while in high school I got a 2-year college degree doing it cuz I was good at it
 yeah but now I want to go into something else
 I'm in school actually I take online classes now for business management
 what's your dream job
 I am really one day I want to own me and my sisters went on our own rental properties in like a real estate company we own fix houses now we bought with our College money and not we want to eventually when they own their own homes and apartment complex it
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot
 meeting new people seeing different things that you've never seen before different languages everything to seeing what the world has to offer
 oh okay me and my sisters went to Hawaii last year
 am I believe we went to Honolulu and then tomorrow we here and we met the people in Hawaii and they were so nice if I can live there I would
 everything was memorable but probably jet skiing in Honolulu was very fun
 outgoing
 music music is much Fairview for me
 well my family is very musically inclined like my dad and my mom's family so music I've always been like that thing no matter how I feel about her music on it makes it much better
 so good to hear
 I'm pretty good I used to box so it let out a lot of frustration so sometimes I do that too I go into the gym and I do like a kickboxing class but I don't I never escalated to the point where I like to learn how older now I can control it pretty much
 well I live with my sister so I argue everyday but it was over clothes my sisters and clothes always close
 my mother and my father are pastors of the church I grew up with two sisters and older brother who was the cop
 and we're pretty close I have a nephew we're pretty close like every day we see each other close and we don't all live in the same house but we're together every single day at some point when we lived in that when we lived in Michigan my family is in Michigan
 when I cheat like right now I'm on a diet with my sisters but last night I snuck and got McDonald so I feel bad because they've been so sticking to it and I cheated but that's pretty good
 me and mine with me and my friend of mine got into it and we said things that weren't like we hit below the belt that we and we usually don't and we haven't spoken in like 3 months now and I know that it could have been prevented if we would have just sit down and talk to each other but it didn't make it that far so yeah
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to me
 probably moving here
 moving to LA because
 like I'm I'm really like what we're really close to our family like I Skype with my mom and dad everyday so it was hard to go from there to here and them taking care of everything to me and my sister do it on our own it was much different
 oh my goodness I'm parents my brother my dad my mom my sister's my family have a great family so my family definitely
 2 years ago 3 years ago my brother was shot on duty
 and he almost lost his life but he didn't and for some reason as much as I try I don't tell them this cuz I don't want them to be like I need to you know whatever but I always think about it over and over again and I'll cry about it like it happened yesterday but it happened three years ago just a mere fact of almost losing him Kinda Yeah
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep not easy I work as a personal assistant and administrative assistant for casting agent so I'm on call for her whenever I'm never I never get a good night sleep ever
 enough
 a zombie I'm pretty much you would never know cuz when is work unprofessional so I am tired they never know but I'm very annoyed and very grouchy when I haven't slept
 how have you been feeling lately
 tired and I have crazy headaches but that's probably from not getting enough sleep and working too much but yeah very tired
 yeah definitely
 I'm shorter with people like
 being in the industry I mean people don't really care if it's all about self and when I first came here I had the I had the personality and attitude of family and love and nice and being here show me that everybody's kind of out for sale fear even though the other girls I work with so I've learned to like cut people off and be short with people when that's not really me but I just see that's how you have to be
 have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD
 last Saturday I did a way in and I lost 7 pounds I was like cited
 how do your best friend describe you
 care too much
 I think about others more than myself so she probably said I care too much I'm loving I'm the person that every friend I have some fighting from best friends and just regular friend so yeah I'm the mom of my friends

 never take no for an answer
