 New York City
 well
 originally I was born here but spend some time back east and move back here and basically sword erased here so
 been here a while and I'm enjoying it
 there's great weather and
 amusement parks lot of scenery lot of people a lot of energy and excitement is so many things to really like about la
 seeing a lot of congestion and pollution
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot
 hi I try to but no I don't
 nice be in the open road with
 telling a time to think about my own life
 shy
 sometimes I find it hard to express my own thoughts
 well you mentioned the fish tank and
 have you spend some time in a many waiting rooms where there's been fish tanks and
 so staring at fish tanks could be one of them but I also enjoy walking or lifting weights reading going to movies sister say if you thinks
 good moderate good
 in control
 argued about today okay last surgery was today just before I got here and it was
 about
 having about how do I say this about taking them to a bus stop about
 help making an arrangement
 feel guilty about
 not taking better care of my pet
 should I I like birds so one of my pets was a bird as of recently
 and
 I
 let my bird out into the wild and sort of wish I had planned for better
 future for the for the bird only because now I sort of wish the bird was
 closer to me
 tell me about a situation that you wished you would handle differ
 I would say I get into arguments with people close to me friends and
 sometimes I I don't handle them well I am more
 reactive
 so I wish I'd like to see myself improve on that
 no at least not you know not any sort of legal trouble but
 I think it's you know it's kind of
 not the way that I would like to have handled it
 okay
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had
 guess the hardest decision was about to
 of
 how to
 proceed with
 moving forward on
 8
 job opportunity
 I had to
 decide whether
 if I would
 suffer more emotional Pain by leaving
 my family and weather the financial gain and knowledge
 of that experience would wood over outweigh the benefit
 yes yes I am
 well I see small family but
 have a mother and a
 a sister and a brother
 and two younger nieces
 the older 3rd ter grown adults good relationship and
 things could be better sometimes it's so difficult pain
 staking
 have relationships at times
 there's a some days I'm
 I need time for myself and I would rather give the time to
 other people rather than the take time for myself which has been my experience and so
 that has caused me a me a lot of emotional
 pain a little bit of spiritual
 anxiety about my future if I continue to do that sort of thing
 tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
 there's so many things about you I don't know anything about you
 I would say this few but of recent I am
 things are going pretty good can really say there's anything as of yet that I would really want to change or or have anything to regret on so I can remember
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 it's been pretty good
 and
 sense8 it's okay
 I'm handling my sleep pretty well
 when I don't sleep well sometimes I can be irritable
 sometimes it's okay
 and I would say if
 there's also times where I'm
 unhappy
 so
 I tried it
 get as much sleep as I need
 yes
 I
 I believe I was 19
 and
 I'm glad I did it
 yes sort of but yes
 no
 well
 yes I suppose it made me more confident person and more
 in tune with
 the country that I'm living in and people
 to be more noticeable more watchful of where I live
 hanging out with some friends on a really nice weekend and on a boat
 or I can ask if it's really small boat and
 trying to fish in
 I felt free or Alive happy
 home
 uninhibited strong confident mature
 half in the military
 I have to mention
 take some time to evaluate my
 my thoughts and
 my future and just sort of took the necessary steps to move ahead
 it's sort of hard it is
 I wasn't easy lot of family help and and community
 and
 so it took some adjusting but it wasn't easy
 no
 no
 tell me about the last time you felt really happy

 Happy's a happy sort of often not too happy but
 content happy happy
 I don't know that usually to happy try to stay
 on the Centerline
 suspend your ideal weekend
 The Weeknd
 I'm up early get out enjoy the day
 hook up with some friends and
 doing a little bit of socializing
 and
 maybe get some form of Bone
 view some form of artistic expression
 there's a maybe you'd like a museum start some art or
 maybe something in the local community maybe street art
 and
 or perhaps something with music or
 something something of that nature
 I wish perhaps some things that I could change about myself
 may be more decisive about decisions
 and something else
