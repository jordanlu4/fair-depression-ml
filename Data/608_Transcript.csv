 so you're going to see everybody
 okay
 yes
 I'm so young
 I'm second
 San Bernardino California
 the weather is nice
 will still like about La it's very sunny
 I like the people here
 I don't like how it's spread out it is and
 how long was that I don't like the the lack of public transportation
 and I don't like that everything shuts down at 2 a.m.
 introverts yes I do
 why
 because I tend to be very stoic I don't tend to
 I don't know express myself so much and I tend to be very reserved and not
 really forthcoming about my feelings Etc
 I'm not sure I understand the question exactly but
 I can't really say I just I just Retreat Within Myself and I don't
 tend to express what I'm thinking or feeling
 that makes sense
 I'm second
 second place
 what the
 whipping
 what do I do when I'm alone bicycle locks
 yeah right by school like very like everywhere I'm a bicycle commuter and I also like and I'll read a lot
 I'm very good at controlling my temper I don't
 I mean I'm so good at repressing repressing my feelings are that my very really Express I mean I don't know I don't really Express anger or else I don't really feel anger because
 I'm not an angry person I may be very disappointed at when something bad happens but that won't erupt in a in a rage I don't feel I don't really feel Rachel but I know I'm so exposed to it all the time on the road I see people like me at all yelling at each other and screaming has so it's yeah I totally cultivate my serenity
 what time I argue with someone
 which would have been the job-related arguments and
 now what I said in school
 I started English
 American literature
 currently unemployed then was my most recent job was at as a as a tutor and before that I've been a grant writer payroll Clerk
 I've had like an assortment of jobs
 yeah I agree I agree
 what's my dream job
 I'd like to be an editor I'd like to
 like I'd Publications
 or like right stories for Publications I feel more comfortable being another Direction more comfortable like working with Pros done with I guess I producing my own. So I like to be like another applications editor
 yeah
 travel a lot
 I'd like to travel I've tried before
 one of those memorable experiences I
" I'm pretty close to my family back out here to be closer to them about 2 years ago from Chicago and so I'm closer to them now
 I'm sick and I'm sorry I don't really understand
 I'm pretty well Chicago it was fun over there was working as a grant writer and we're there for grad school but either dropping out of grad school but the finding work has been over 5 years I like it alot
 Mallory situation I'm okay with it right now I'm living with a relative it's
 it could be better but right now is like right now but employed and it's like I said anything to me stay rent-free and so I'm okay right now before I'm at but I really do need to find another job so I can
 I get myself stabilized
 yeah I'm living with my uncle and
 you know like I say at this place and so
 he's kind of eccentric
 I don't know how subscribe them he's pretty out there but anyway he's okay guy
 do I have a source of what
 I'm sorry do I have
 I can really barely hear what you're saying and it's hard for me to understand you sometimes but I'll wait for you to answer me or ask me a question
 no I haven't
 no I haven't but I've
 awesome felt oppressed
 but I never had a diagnosis of depression
 I've been feeling good lately I mean relatively I mean
 I prefer being unemployed and feeling like really angsty over that that's
 you know I'm in a position where I can you know you know I can't sort of like survive out here which is important and
 and I'm not homeless which is important so I feel okay I mean yeah I could be doing a lot better on the other hand I'm not on the streets and things could be much worse
 no I haven't
 I'm not sure what the question was if I'd like to send some kind of therapy
 I've been in therapy before but it hasn't
 I don't know I was supposed to be there people like the therapist and I wasn't like really
 it didn't really help me out so much like a slight work at my issues but I enjoy talking to a therapist and I guess that's kind of like a pair of the whole situation to to the scenario talking to a virtual human that you just have someone to sit with for a while he will listen to you it someday I could be very soothing Melody
 I feel that way often well do I feel like I need to talk to someone very often
 sometimes I mean yeah I do like repressed emotions like man the pretty much I assumed I could ever become black holes with someone I would have someone I can share my thoughts and feelings with butts
 I was like I guess you can say I do feel what's the word I feel lonely but not lonely but like for a self contained within
 what's the word within my own sort of sense of self my own feelings and I don't really
 have a need to reach out as much because
 I'm a practice God I practice meditation and I totally totally helps me like next to retreat into myself in lights are like fine fine serenity serenity through a lack of desire and soap that helps me with
 I mean I guess I could loneliness but also I mean maybe it was like you know it like a problem I actually don't reach out to people as often as I should but I definitely neglected relationships because of that
 and it may all be as like self-centeredness you know but
 I'm trying to oh yeah this is a good one I want to try to find a way to Lake engage with people without like really
 allowing myself to let them down so to speak and so that is
 one of the things that inhibits me from reaching out to people is the idea that I could that I could potentially let them down if they were to place their faith in me or the trust in me and so I'm very reluctant to do that
 go on
 how easy it is for me I don't really again I'm only hearing part part of what you're saying and so
 this is going to throw off my answer
 I would say it's very easy I mean I can't really like I don't understand the question for Quan
 what I'm I think I said it would only was afraid of probably most afraid of
 oh my God being a failure or not being a success finding a stable job
 not being able to
 I mean settle down and essentially ain't getting married
 it's um I don't know I am okay with being single I'm not okay with being jobless
 I'm so it's like one of those things that's just like
 I just I don't feel I can reach out to people so because I don't have a job and so I got to like bring them into my mic my life so right right now I'm not in position to like a people I mean
 they have a lot of friends with us because I can't like really go outside and they can so you know spend money at
 and restaurants or in clubs or whatever
 so I'm going to buy to a lots and I think a lot so I meditate a lots and I read a lot of literature
 I want to go to my felt really happy
 well just last weekend that was set my
 my aunt and uncle's 50th one of your anniversary and it was a nice occasion it was really it was not their whole family was there are friendly was there and
 like my own parents 50th anniversary is coming up 50/50 years together and
 I felt really happy for them I felt really happy that I got both of them and provided us with like a really
 a really great childhood and
 it seems strange I guess I put that kind of starting point but that's something I mean I guess like suit to be floundering right now but I feel happy for the
 I think I guess locations like that are probably could become rarer on his light on a societal level but that some sort of like Beyond Leon sort of like Realm of happiness and anyway this weekend. I'm on the road on a bicycle and going pretty fast
 how are your best friends
 my best friend
 actually
 she would describe me as depressed all the time and I asked her about this and he's like I swear if it being around me I had brought her down at all because she was going through her own like for a deep depression that I was kind of trying to coax her out of that but it sometimes myself and so
 I asked her if you're around me brought her down at all and she said no it's it made her that I had liked it but I take an interest in her but
 what's the word let's would like my sort of like my depression wasn't like really the net didn't have anything to do with her depression it was completely unrelated to like how I felt and feel like I don't know in both cases it was just good to have someone else to be around who had some respect for
 like it's like how we felt or like alarm useful sort of like lack of feeling and I can put it that way and so has being brave I seem very depressed all the time and she's my best friend
 at this moment
 anything I regret
 all right
 thank you
 goodbye
 hello and goodbye
 hello
 it was kind of interesting as like I should have like told you I had like my ears are kind of kind of clogged and so I had trouble like during her at some at some point
