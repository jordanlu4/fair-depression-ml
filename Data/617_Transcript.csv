wow
 okay
 I broke it
 not so good
 okay
 all right questions and then when she's done she should say goodbye and you can press this button
 okay
 okay
 should be how good
 yes
 I'm doing pretty good
 originally I was born in Denver Colorado
 I like the beach sunshine
 pretty girls
 the ocean
 other things
 smog
 excess amount of people in traffic that can be dealt with
 I would like to travel more
 seeing new things and and learning perhaps if you culture or something
 oh okay I when I was younger I went to Europe and just did the backpacking thing
 backpack around Europe for a little while and it was it was real fun
 I'm probably just being in the military with some friends and stuff like that
 why have a degree in film and I'm finishing a degree in or for business as well
 now I look for work I'm trying to do some sort of entrepreneurial effort now as I finish my business degree
 it'd probably be to own my own company that's kind of why I want some sort of entrepreneurial effort to push push for with some sort of interesting product or service that I'd be working in
 I would say middle of the road a little bit shy and at times can be takes a while to warm up
 are you cautious to meet someone new and then from there
 I kind of see where to go from there I guess
 my family they still live in Colorado their interesting people and good as well as I talk to him
 pray couple times a week they're good people I have one brother and he has a couple of kids and that he's married as well
 that's a good question lately I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike and recently got a bike
 something like that on a daily
 effort
 for the most part pretty good I try to if I have an outburst or if I'm being irritable I try to stay away from people who didn't like to go off on people they didn't do anything wrong
 Edward change the topic in my mind I guess
 what gets me in trouble would be more I avoid things and it kind of builds up and becomes worse
 and that kind of gets the trouble and
 basically just in a relationship with a girlfriend
 to be honest with that it remember exactly what it was about it's just probably in one of us is being irritable and me and
 going from there or it's probably a lot to do with the money as well I don't have the best financial security at this point
 that's a good question
 oh my I guess I I do Harbor a little bit of guilt from the military as far as getting out and people are still in I suppose I know that's it's not for me anymore
 only thing well I I used to work at for a friend and I invested into his company
 and the economy went down was a construction accessory company basically and kind of movement down and we lost most of our money like most of the folks around America and that pretty much
 it was a good and bad thing is you got to look at it from a good good perspective but it definitely put it myself into talespin I financially and couldn't really do anything about it almost was homeless for a little while
 but I I wish I wouldn't have invested into the company and just move forward and
 perhaps going to school like I'm going anyway
 I have
 I was 21
 I wanted a change in life I wanted some more real-world experiences
 answer my country and also the added benefits of going to school or nice I didn't have
 much Financial capabilities at that time and I wanted to change to get out of my current situation and that was the best way out I thought
 are you happy
 yeah yeah I'm very happy I join the military I appreciate it now more that I mount and understanding kind of what I supposed war was about it is definitely changing people and myself as well
 yeah I did a tour both in Iraq and Afghanistan as well
 see I thought at first it was very easy and then I came to understand he was very difficult
 just because I was adjusting from military life and still having that in my head and not until now I realize that I probably just a few months ago
 to Reno reintegrate myself a little bit better and choose civilian life which it's it's actually it's actually pretty difficult
 no problem
 movie think I when I got out of the military
 versus I'd I invested like I said into my friend's company and we started that little business we're doing well for the while working and then lost all of our money
 and then I traveled for a while at a gender stand now is obviously some other issues but I traveled all over America good working and went to school in New York for a little while
 lived in a few different states and came back to California where I'm finishing school finally
 living the dream
 that's a good question I would say
 well it didn't and instills you with with very good I think since of
 sense of character and strength and you know I think there's a lot of good qualities that the military are military puts a new people but at the same time it puts a lot of bad qualities
 as well because you need some sort of edge or something that you need on on am almost daily basis and if you don't get that then in a lot of guys do you know turn into drinking or drugs just cuz you can't get that same Edge
 and that really that can really either hurt or benefit you
 I've been feeling okay I've had a bit of a sinus issues lately but I've been feeling okay
 actually I have my my thoughts I used to really have scattered thoughts
 and
 I would say I'm starting to get a little bit better Clarity which is good
 taking a lot of different therapy and stuff like that and it it's actually helped
 it's it's very as I can't really let the tough part for me is the schedule because that's if I'm not tired you don't sleep you just lay there
 it's Hit or Miss really some nights I can sleep pretty well some nights I have to wait till I'm exhausted
 and I don't like doing pills
 pills are bad I didn't understand that but it's basically just can't sleep because either you're on my mind is always thinking about something or something I feel that I have to do but yet I'm not doing anything that's not true trying to always do something or do you have some some troubling dreams at times but that doesn't really negate me from sleeping and wakes me up is what it does because it can't be that the dream that you remember versus the one that you don't
 when I don't sleep well
 perhaps your ability and anxiety definitely go up I I definitely get I have a tendency to get a lot of headaches
 and not sleeping very well definitely puts that into the mix
 I have
 not that I know of no
 I I don't know I try to feel happiness on a daily basis I guess what you could answer but I'm not certain
 I'll say my my dad's been a very positive influence
 that's a good question charismatic her funguy pretty tough
 a good worker
 I'd say I really enjoyed jogging
 the other day on the beach
 something that I am most proud of I would say I'm actually an online Minister as well and I married my brother and his wife and that was a pretty proud experience
 all good
 she said goodbye
 okay
