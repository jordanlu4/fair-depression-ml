okay
yes
I'm doing good
 I was born in Lynwood
 I like all the sightseeing and all the
 clothing stores that they have
 well something's all the graffiti basically all the wrongdoing criminal activity and all that bad stuff
 I've traveled in the past. I don't really go out of state
 basically
 budget money money budget expenses doesn't let me to go to another state
 I started automotive technology and Welding
 does a passion for car since I was little always basically
 just wanted to work on cars
 pretty
 yeah I really love working on cars
 my dream job would probably be
 play to own my own automotive shop or two on the barbershop or two just basically be
 probably a master welder
 consider myself a little more outgoing
 just because I like having fun being
 just having fun with my friends being able to do anything that please
 basically just smoke on my free time sometimes or just lay down watch a movie listen to some music
 please play hip hop music or maybe a good comedy movie
 I'm fairly easy about it I don't really let go get let my bad side get to my emotions
 probably earlier today about with my girlfriend or wife basically about where we going to go eat
 spell desperate for an answer for her to tell me where she wanted to go eat since she wouldn't make up her mind kind of made me uneasy
 play just to relax and stay calm more than just two I'll burst and raise my voice
 wrongdoings in my past basically anything I could have changed
 how to better myself
 basically doing something better out of job or maybe
 not doing the job at my greatest
 hardest decision would have to be
 to plan a family probably
 I'm just basically making sure all the situations are where they're supposed to be and fucking it out with my partner if already ready to begin a family
 does basically
 the love and bond between me and my wife
 basically might be like a crash accident
 basically pretty horrific scary experience when I almost crashed into the freeway barrier
 the car spun out and basically you almost ended up off of a little Hill
 has a pretty scary experience as far as
 so I've been in the car by myself not being able to control the vehicle at all I'm just hoping that I was going to be okay
 how easy is it for you to get a
 it's fairly easy eggs if I as long as I've had a good dinner early on in my day fairly would have go to sleep pretty good
 just restless and just a little more stress constant things more will be on my mind
 lack of energy Maybe
 imprime pretty relaxed calm
 not really same old me day today to try to stay happy and relax calm just try to stay positive energy
 no I have not been diagnosed
 no I have not been diagnosed by depression
 earlier today when I have some food
 it's pretty close bonded it was good we talked about a lot of unnecessary stuff try to help each other out at all times
 my father my sister
 my mother
 well my father has been there for as long as my mother has been and she they've both helped me as much as possible from school to clothing to take me and my sister she's basically graduated from college so she's like a mentor to me kind of look up to her as far as graduating school and everything try to keep going
 and they're pretty fun
 they're out bursting Minds basically just smarter
 kind of seem
 more advanced thinking compared to what the kids were probably thinking back in the in the old age I learned things a little more quicker
 no not majorly just things that I could have thought I could have done better or
 are just a little differently
 I like building my car differently getting traffic violations basically just
 kind of wish I wouldn't have spent through intersections or got another tickets I've received on my record
 outer basically
 just after you realize it the first time try not to do it again so the same mistake doesn't happen
 is my Persona kind of as far as a whenever I'm angry just to find a way to be more easy-going maybe try to
 not be so much of a negative thinker at times when things get a little harder
 basically when somebody
 accuses you of wrongdoing that probably has hasn't been done
 basically when a police officer tells you you've done wrong when you clearly know that you have not done anything wrong
 play earlier this year
 basically a police officer pulled me over for thinking that I was a drunk driver made me feel really really dumb all by myself or try to accuse me of wrongdoing that I've been drinking and smoking one that was not the cause I was just very tired. And I was totally am therefore I was trying to look probably a little sleepy
 just
 fun cool
 easy going good attitude
 loyal
 drifting drifting my 240SX spending quality time with my My Wife and Kids
 basically
 everything I've done for myself from when I graduated high school so now
 thank you bye
