 I'm doing fine thank you
 Macon Georgia
 yeah I'm from Macon Georgia
 I like the city
 I sometime like the fast-paced of it I like the weather the beaches and I like the opportunities that you have here versus
 any other cities that I've been that I lived in so loved the weather is nice city to live in
 traffic traffic and
 the property here is very expensive
 pretty spread out city is hard to kind of get two things if you don't have a car that makes it hard and the mass the transportation here is not as good so are those are just a few things that I I don't like about la
 not as not as much as I like to
 what I enjoy about traveling is boarding a plane and going somewhere that you possibly never been before I like the idea of where you going you may experience new things meet new people and just a overall fact of getting out of your environment
 sort of the Rat Race as I call it
 one of my trips is been such a long long time ago I went to your particular I flew into Belgium that was a great experience and I went to visit my brother that stayed in Belgium Brussels and I was over there for two weeks I got to visit I actually drove from Belgium
 to Germany
 and drove from Berlin Germany to Paris France so the experience was great
 the people is great
 The Nightlife was good. Enjoy the time of Europe I really liked it
 could you repeat that again
 why didn't further my education in college but I did finish high school and some of the subject that I liked and I was in high school was I love American history
 and I enjoyed science stairs with some to a my top subjects when I was in high school
 what do you do now
 and now I work in real estate I work for a guy in real estate and I find property's or properties that has been abandoned by their owners or whoever that live there and if we can find the people we we we offered them a contract on the property then once they agree to that everybody signs off on it and then we start to go in and rehabitat the place fix it up clean it up and turn around and sell it at all and I put up Advertising Signs for the business also so I'm evolve a little bit into real estate
 I don't know if I have a dream job but
 my success would lie on
 being financially secure which I find
 real estate can bring that once I start to achieve it so I guess my dream job would be to
 how my own slower properties throughout California and possibly throughout some other states in our country and just doing very well in real estate
 outgoing
 because I'm I'm more open to people of different cultures I love to talk
 I love to engage in intellectual conversations I like to debate I'm not sure I'm very open to any Topic in the subject that anyone want to speak about or speak on
 so I consider myself very outgoing
 my relationship with my family is very good my dad is deceased
 I've about
 maybe 11 12 years now my mother is still alive she's live back in Georgia. Believe she's 75 years old now for social switch still resides in Georgia or brother that lives in outside Detroit
 so that makes up my family I contact them on a weekly basis via email or text
 or phone call or very close very close Southern family and I love them very much just don't get to see them as much as I like to
 I'm what I do to relax is to connect with on some close friends also I found out if I
 going to work out or
 do my thing is sort of really stressed I like to work out so a lot of times I go and take the dog for a walk or I'll watch a nice comedy on television so that's sort of how I get to
 relieve the stress in my life
 I'm very easy I'm I'm very hard to get upset so it's nothing to control their but when I do feel like there is a temple coming on I sort of think about something else to do or
 just Don allowed to control me
 always think of something positive to do when I feel like my temper is starting to escalate
 when was the
 the last time I argue with someone was some
 just last night my girlfriend where it was an argument but she felt like I wasn't giving her enough attention and I felt like I was giving her a lot of attention so neither one of us was willing to give an inch that's that's a trademark of aquarius so we sort of Argyll way to sleep
 not a big argument but we just couldn't agree on what we wanted to get across to one another
 I was basically about not enough time spent together
 trying to think of a situation that I handled differently
 sometimes feel guilty about is a divorced that
 I did I went through about 7 years ago I should have thought it out
 a lot more than I did before I made the decision I did so
 I guess if that's the case I guess that would be something that I wish I could have done different
 the hardest has not ever had to make was
 agreeing to go into the military and I thought about it I didn't want to do it so it was a really hard decision because I knew once I had agreed to do it
 to sign my name then I was obligated to go so that was a very hard decision
 yes
 I was 20
 I believe I was 21 between 21 22 years old
 I felt like actually going back to that first question I was about 19 years old when I joined the military I felt good about it
 it was something I thought about doing and I wanted to do it I felt like it was
 becoming of a man back then to join the military and I thought good about it and as I look at it today really kind of
 set me up to the point that I'm in my life now with the discipline and the structure of your life and your your family life so it really kind of
 molded me into the person that I am at that I am now
 are you having a good day
 am I happy
 yes
 I went to the Gulf
 I went to the Gulf War
 in 1985 I spent six six months in a cup of Romaine in 1985 and that was a really
 really tough experience right there for me
 very hot very dangerous are in a hostile environment
 I was really easy because after 4 years of serving in military I was I was done I was I was over it I was right to get back into civilian world and see what
 the civilian world had to offer me
 and so far as been good but I'm glad at the same time I'm glad I had that military experience you know that that military back and I have in my back pocket but I was ready for civilian life in
 it's been great
 author military I worked for
 about 14 years as a security officer real nice job good pay unfortunate in 2005
 my department was cut out due to the company not willing to negotiate our contract again so after 14 years of that I was let go
 IAP made me more more rounded person it made me
 see things a little different and civilian life it makes you a little bit stronger and make sure a little bit more discipline than the regular
 and a gift your foundation
 how to go about your business in civilian life is sort of
 commit to me this major
 better person all the way around how to accept things I have to accept different peoples in different cultures and it just makes you open up with your your thinking process
 have you noticed any changes
 I've been feeling
 and I'm pretty good lately not as good as I want to feel but I've been I've been I've been feeling okay
 how easy is it for you to go
 lately has been little bit hard because for some reason my neck have been tightening up on me so it's been a little bit difficult to get a good night sleep. Over the last couple weeks or so
 that's been a lot going on
 a little bit edgy little bit not attentive a little bit uneasy
 those are some of the things that you know normally happens to me when I don't sleep well
 no I haven't
 I know I haven't
 I guess I felt really happy
 when I was able to move away from my mother-in-law's house and move into my own house which is about 4 years ago
 and I made me really happy because me and my four kids and Kearney at that time my wife was all staying with
 my mother-in-law and which we stay there for five years so I thought when we got our house I was so happy because I could do what I want to do I could move around as I wanted to in until
 make me happy made my family happy also
 I would say my mother course and my brother and my mother course because she's the one that brought me
 and my brothers because I sort of see how he goes about his business and I sort of
 sort of meaning
 so I don't want to go down that same road as he's gone down and so those are my two
 role models that she will call it
 genuine
 upbeat friendly positive
 all the
 something I did recent that I really enjoyed
 nice
 having my three kids
 thank you
 goodbye
