 somebody's excessive drinking

 okay
 well stuff that were dating back 20 years ago things in my marriage
 maybe arguing or
 being difficult
 sure I could have
 I could have been more mindful in certain situations
 one of them was whether or not I was should
 get married when I was much younger
 I didn't want to disappoint my my girlfriend she wanted to get married so I didn't want to hurt her feelings
 are you happy
 yes
 I think I did that didn't I
 instances where I wasn't an attentive father
 you always want to be the best you can I'm very hard on myself.
 I'm very tired I think back in every situation where I don't think I have them myself properly
 I have a 28 year old 27 year old son who just got married last month and he's doing very well he's happy and adjusted my daughter is 21 and she's in school and
 she is doing very well also so my kids are come out very well and very lucky that they are such good kids

 no
 being consistent
 keeping your emotions in check
 unconditional love from your kids

 my parents were abusive
 they threw me out and added that I didn't live with them I live in a foster home
 and I'm not like that I don't I don't get my kids and I didn't hit my kids I still don't have them
 and I think I'm a better parent
 I'm close with my son my daughter not so close but somewhat that's all that's my entire family my two kids

 sometimes it's mostly
 I don't know I don't know if it's useful or not sometimes I think it is sometimes I think it isn't
 not much
 very little changes
 I'm not sure I've been in therapy for a long time so I don't
 it's been a long time so I don't know what changes I contribute to therapy or to myself
 tell me about the last time you felt
 last month at my son's wedding I was happy
 how to say my son happy and doing well and successful in
