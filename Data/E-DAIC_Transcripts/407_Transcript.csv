oh so she's like going to be counselor kind of
 and then I just press that
 and then we just have that again and they're done cool
 haikal
 are you okay
 yes
 I'm actually I feel pretty good cuz I I I slept all day yesterday almost I'm usually doing something if not work it's cool if it's not school it's work and then social life and all that so I actually didn't have work yesterday and I don't have school on have school on the weekdays so I actually slept probably like 85% of the days I actually feel kind of good but I'm actually kind of tired as well I have other stuff going on but other than that I'm good today
 okay
 I'm originally from Bakersfield California
 really
 I'm so late when I was an infant and I'm left here when I was around 3 or 4 and I've been moved I moved back here in 07 and I've been living here ever since
 well since I've been here since 07 I've only been back maybe
 maybe like
 couple why were there at 4 like a summer like in 08 I think I was there for like almost all summer but I don't even back up a couple times and since I've been back here
 unfortunately
 it compared to La doesn't really compare. I grew up in Sacramento actually I didn't get to tell you I was born in Bakersfield and I lived here anyways I don't know if I did I forgot anyways yeah there's like nothing really to do there it's really small as to Valley La has all the stuff to do has oceans and his file kinds of located on by a lot of cool places like Vegas and San Diego and what have you not but yeah other than that I miss my friends and stuff that I don't miss like actual City I just missed some of the people that I grew up with
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I can't see your shoes but I don't travel after I've only been out of California like six time so I would like to travel inside
 have enough money to do so
 I want to be a filmmaker and which I still want to be a filmmaker and I said I was 10 I took Communications and the general that stuff too and took my video production classes and did a lot of stuff in regards to I'm filmmaking and I have learned a lot of stuff and I still have that knowledge however I haven't really used it since I've been back here in La I did all that stuff in Northern California in Sacramento but and then I transfer switch over to be at the business which I took some classes in that but now I'm actually studying to be an optician and I'm actually almost done with schooling and getting ready to try to get infield and become an optician so
 but I do want to be I still want to be a filmmaker and I'm that still one of my plans and I still actually I got into I'm playing poker 2 years ago and I really like the idea of becoming a full-time filmmaker or full-time poker player have it both of those jobs are extremely difficult to make a living out of it have to be like a small percent so we'll see if not then hopefully my optician career could take me somewhere
 3 oxygen
 I guess I was just trying to find something that it was like it it's like a trade it supposed to private college but it just like specifically trained you into one feel then you just learned that you don't do like your GED and all these other classes like you normally do for like like a major or whatever you're going to do so it just trains you to civically to be auditioning and jump in the field I took it just because I actually want to be a dental assistant sound like something maybe I could do it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually got my attention to be optician so I'm now trying to be an optician and it's interesting so it's fine it's really hard but it's interesting in it and it and it's it's fine
 we want to benefit this far as like being able to help people see better and feel comfortable with glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel welcome for what
 I'm definitely outgoing however I can be shy sometimes like I'm kind of shy right now because talking to you and your computer and your cartoon or animated or whatever but no usually 98%
 I turn on the
 hey
 but it's the best I've got
 I actually was actually kind of funny and I think maybe this might go further some of the poker players to really I've never really talked to any professional poker player to be as far as like I actually playing poker is actually something that helps me forget about anything as far as like
 stuff in the past or present or future stuff is coming up as far as like I am really would I really do not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kind of like a therapy thing for me cuz I don't like I guess you could say the kind of drug because I don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed our stuff that's happened in the past I just like focus on poker so it's actually kind of relieved and however playing poker is very stressful on top of that so I guess it's kind of like a catch-22 or whatever but yeah so no poker I put like to play basketball I like to watch movies I can go to the beach actually one of the things I like to do is go to the beach cuz it does it makes me feel good but I usually when you go to the beach when it's hot. During the cold season so it's coming up soon so looking forward to that I'm really busy but I'll try to go to the beach because I can't
 I'm really good at controlling my temper actually I've only been in like I'm 30 years old I've been in like six fights maybe and all six of them were started by the other person so I've never started a real fight in my whole life like I started fighting a little kid but talking about like a real stuff like what you get past like 13-14 but yeah I know I'm good like every now and then like there's been in the past were like I wasn't able to control it
 but as far as I ever being violent or anyting that's never occurred and never would but for the majority of the time yeah I don't have like people do stupid things all the time and I just like Let It Go expect to like I'm on the freeway and stuff but
 oh I mean I get about with my ex girlfriend a lot but it was just about really Petty things I guess that maybe we just I think we were good for each other but maybe some other lifetime because we just bumped head too much so obviously she's my ex-girlfriend probably for a reason so
 we just argued about girlfriend boyfriend thing
 I guess my film
 there's a lot of stuff I got to handle differently about
 maybe like when I was doing really good when I was younger and I was working for
 production assistant for a filmmaker's around where I live in Sacramento so I was doing everything that I want to do as far as my dreams are concerned and had a lot on my stuff together I have my own car mode apartment and then I got involved with like the wrong group of people I guess and kind of tumble down hill from there in like lost everything like our apartment so I just wish that maybe I never got involved with those kind of people that kind of girl ever
 because I would probably a pirate my life probably a lot different now however I believe that everything happens for a reason and obviously I think you should also like stuff that happens good or bad
 learn from your mistakes so that when it happens again you could not make that mistake our try not to make it as bad yes so you know
 I guess
 hardest decision
 the hardest decision I have ever had the maid would be
 I guess you could say I don't really know
 can I say that I
 maybe like my ex-girlfriend like I couldn't like
 stayed with her and I really like it still am in love with her and would like to be with her and miss her but I guess the biggest decision that I had to make was like I know that wasn't like a healthy relationship and I know if we like stay together if we got married or have kids that I don't think would end up working out anyways so I guess the decision the hardest decision would be till like actually stay away from her and not get back with her and not with her so I guess that was a hard really hard decision because I could easily have done it and I guess maybe I would have been happier that way but stressed out and irritable or whatever and other way of having to deal with her iguess deal with each other our relationship so it's really hard still is so I guess that's not choosing to be with someone that I loved and loved me
 or whatever so
 what was that
 I beg your pardon
 navad
 I understand the first part of that question
 oh an event own event okay that can erase
 event that I can erase for my memory
 IMAX girlfriend I wish I never met her
 my first girlfriend in my last girlfriend I wish I never met them cuz we were we were together and love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard so I guess both of them
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep extremely I could fall asleep anywhere I actually the other day I broke a record I almost fell asleep standing up which would have been weird because I guess I would have fallen down or something I don't know I just caught myself I guess I was I mean I was really tired but I do a lot of stuff so it's hard for I don't really get that much sleep
 as much as I would like but I can sleep when I'm dead or whatever
 have they said
 I know
 no
 lately I'm just tired but I'm all right I guess I'm dealing with this breakup still it's only been like a month and a week but it's actually is not I mean I've had worse things happen I mean worst things happening had worse things happen to us
 well-known religious person that I'm Catholic I believe in God I know there's a God so obviously even though all of it even devoted people to God regardless of what they are they sometimes stay so I do stay sometimes but definitely last for that long and I know that there is a God and I know that I'll be okay and everything will be okay but you know it's hard to deal with them like I don't really I just keep going and I go to school and work and I just have to keep going I can't give up so I just try to stay busy and staying busy helps kind of been like sleeping a lot house but I don't go to sleep a lot so I don't know playing poker
 playing basketball helps me deal with him hanging out with my friend sometime
 I felt really happy on Friday because I went to San Diego for the first time and I didn't it wasn't as cool as I thought it would be but we're like under circumstances as far as like my friend had business to take care of and it took a long time so I would much rather been free during that time but I wasn't but we had fun it was cool I enjoyed it so yeah I really like that I was at fun and I was happy about going to San Diego for the first time and I am had a good time
 a lot of things but I guess I would say like be nicer to like family members know a couple family members that I wish I would have been different to
 at the different to not that I was like a horrible but I could have been nicer in some instances that if I didn't know the situation at hand and I would have never like really went out and partied all the time like I did like Highschool different part times of a type I would have just really focused on schooling and stuff them in to the party later would have gotten relationships that I'm sorry I just told myself more basely to be more have more Direction be more focused I guess I stay away from people and unhealthy relationships and healthy people I guess not that I'm the healthiest but yeah I just want it done a lot of stuff different but I don't know if she said earlier but I believe everything happens for a reason
 so I guess everything is happening now for reason something to keep going
 I guess there's a few that I do have a few that I used to have cuz I have best friends now couple I guess one new one and I've lost a few best friends as far as like just not we like 100 ways but I guess they're all probably describe me more as like energetic funny crazy loud silly
 smart and I just I guess in general just like entertaining to be around I have
 I haven't always been the best bestest best friend but I tried you know my hardest
 so that's cool
 change myself
 I wish I was
 I wish I was like 15 pounds lighter
 I wish I didn't need
 how do I set potatoes I feel like
" I feel like I'm I feel like I need to be like in a relationship with a girl but I feel like I wish I didn't have to be like feel like that I needed to have a girl all the time and so I get that
 step dad in my life
 but that sometimes I'm working on that
 what am I most proud of
 I'm most proud of
 almost I guess I guess I'm most proud of working for television station back in Sacramento and working on a lot of them film sets cuz like I I was 16 and I decided I want to be a filmmaker and then two years later or year-and-a-half later you basically I got I started making steps to become a filmmaker and then I ended up working in the business and working as a filmmaker for a really really really good I'm cinematographer I really good I'm freelancing to Target for those that lives in Sacramento that deal I think so I'm proud that I had a dream and I went for it and I actually ended up doing stuff to go toward my dream that were in my dream so I guess that's one of my biggest accomplishment which was like over 10 years ago but I know hopefully something like that could happen again soon or no
 perfect
 goodbye
 cool
