you just look at Ali
so she's asking a series of questions and then using
yes
all right
 I was born in Philadelphia but we lived all over that the place so I'm not from Philadelphia to just before in there and live there for a year
 I love the weather people are generally more friendly than where I've lived on the East Coast the scenery the environment the beach the mountains the bike paths and the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables
 the usual the traffic I guess some of the people in the entertainment business a bit of the materialism and you know when you meet like the stereotypical deaths
 I used to when I used to have a life I been to 41 countries and I really enjoyed that
 wish I could do it again one day
 I guess since I'm from nowhere it's fun to go somewhere where
 it doesn't you don't have to fit in your already a weirdo so it doesn't matter that you're not from the place and I just really enjoy eating meeting people from different cultures I love seeing new environments I love seeing historical things are now just things been credible Beauty I love meeting different types of people food I love different food so any foods for money foreign Land Rovers fun and any other thing I secretly like that I try not to get too wrapped up in is that if you can completely and utterly escaped and forget about your real life
 how to write let me think for a minute
 I don't know which one to pick
 I guess I
 I'm trying to think in my head I probably shouldn't be overthinking I'm trying to think do I pick a horrible one to give you guys more emotion or do I pick a normal what are my traveling companion was my
 you know husband too I don't know what his story is I suppose he's gay
 so we went to to Singapore and it was just fabulous I except for the parts having to deal with him I loved being there and you know the variety of delicious unbelievable food I'm a huge kraylix I've been so that was really fun it's a big shopping place so I kind of wished I were a bit younger cuz they had fabulous fashions
 I like the weather cuz it was hot and steamy it was really easy to get around
 things like that
 let's see for some reason I'm thinking of a bad one nothing I assume you mean towards travel when I was traveling through Vietnam and Cambodia I got a really bad case of hemorrhoids hemorrhagic dengue fever
 I was in hiding
 why wasn't I was in accentuate sorry in Vietnam and I was horribly sick and I was hallucinating and my traveling companion husband person I
 I said please go get me some water I was in a really sweating profusely and I've been very sick for a while and he went out to get the water I don't know sometime in the morning and he came back and I don't know 7 at night or something and said that he some fellow on a motorbike instead let me take you somewhere where you can get some water and I don't know what the hell you did all day long so I just think back to then and I remember coming in and out of Consciousness and thinking I'm going to die here and I wondered if I would ever be and I found in this hotel we were staying so I don't know how I survived and I'm probably over dramatizing it but
 it was just memorable because I often think back and when I see people sick or whatever and think she why the heck did I survive
 that's not my PTSD thing though if you're wondering
 I studied
 film as an undergrad while I started off and dance and then I realized I wasn't really that talented I mean I was okay but not really that good so I moved over to film and I really enjoyed that and then later on in life I went back to school and I became a lawyer
 I'm an underemployed
 lawyer I guess I I got tossed out with many people you know I Now understand why the what-do-you-call-it the the age discrimination laws kick in after 40 well you know it's extremely difficult to get rehired so now I have a couple of clients I make a couple of pennies you know
 would prefer to be fully employed not really going so well
 so I'm here today to make my 35 measly bucks
 does after paying off all those loans and everything for law school because I stupidly took one of the more expensive law schools in the country so many of you students listening don't do that I mean don't pick an expensive grad school if you don't get financial aid and you don't have a financial help from your family so anyway I because I was spent all my life paying off my undergrad and my graduate schools I now find myself looking down the barrel of long-term unemployment and retirement and not having any you know any insurance or any
 enough for a what they say we're supposed to live to in the future
 not anymore I don't I don't have any dreams left
 when I was younger and my dream job is to be an ambassador because I thought it would just be so much fun to you no have contact with different countries and to get to be friendly and meet people all the time and to represent your country in a positive way
 I know I don't think I have any dreams left I am too old I've
 I've nothing at the world once anymore
 well I was always extremely outgoing and friendly up until maybe I don't know 5 years ago and then I
 I guess I'm so friendly and outgoing I just
 sometimes I just give up and I don't even try anymore
 well it's embarrassing when people say what do you do to say you're unemployed people think I've had so many people say well why don't you just go out and get a job will what are they assume that you're being lazy or something like that where it's like okay assholes at work since I was 12 you know right I didn't have fun during college I worked three jobs to pay for it all and my lungs I don't know I guess I'd I just stopped trying because and I'm a little embarrassed about my situation you know I'm
 quote on quote married to somebody who has this secret life I don't know what his story is I guess I'm embarrassed about my
 my life being so pretty much a complete and utter failure of every every goal that I had
 I go for a bike ride along you lovely bike path I go swimming
 on occasion I will drink have a drink have a low alcohol tolerance so basically one or two will pretty much knocked me out I don't know I used to do yoga and stuff like that nowadays I try to do deep breathing
 it depends who the person is in a normal situation with normal people or with complete strangers
 I'm pretty darn good at it
 with two people I'm no longer any good at it at all my husband and my mother cuz they were both extremely
 physically and emotionally abusive and I finally learned recently on the last maybe 10 years or so that that's the stuff they had that I accepted as normal was not normal so I did all the assertiveness thing where you say this is not no please don't lie to me or whatever the thing they were doing and you know the person supposed to say oh I didn't know that was hurting you let me change but of course that never actually works in real life so now I find that if I must have contact with these people of HIV one of them have to I get extremely if they lie to me I just get fed up and you know
 confront them on it
 well
 what can you give me a chance I guess it was my husband since I'm paying the cell phone bill and he's on the family plan it turned out that he had 44 pages of text while he's off on the secret trip to some summer camp don't ask I don't I don't even want to think about it I don't know who these people are that he's texting with so I asked him what the f are you these text who are you doing this with and I tried calling some of the numbers and the people would just hang up on me so you know my imagination started thinking what the hell is he doing at this summer camp why did the people that he's texting and texting photos to not respond you know draw your own conclusions so you know any wasn't answering me and he kept lying and he's one sentence emails he was sending back so I
 you know I started getting these threats in the e-mails back like oh yeah well if you don't tell me I'm going to call up this number and find out who they were which he wouldn't answer me and then as I said I called and they're just hung up on me so who knows who these people
 well I mean there are the General Life ones like I wish I had never married this person I situation I wish I'd handled differently
 I guess I had a job
" I actually was a head lawyer for a company probably won't believe it now you guys were out there watching this and the the president started doing all these things that were ethically wrong and going against my advice and I should have gotten the Hades out of there I should have quit immediately but I was still paying off you know $200
 gee willikers
 well
 I just see the only real thing I feel guilty about is something I prefer not to discuss on tape I mean I've had enough drinks tell me over the years that I was justified
 hardest decision I tried to make I don't know I mean every stupid a lot of decisions have been difficult the hardest one I've no idea
 the last 49 years
 I I guess I could erase my big pts State when I was 18 a serial killer
 abducted me and I escaped from that I
 now I haven't
 I don't know you know
 sing along
 I don't know
 neither here nor there I'm just numb anymore I don't really care I'm just waiting for you know to die
 well I kind of had a bad blow last week with something
 and
 I just didn't have an appetite for like I don't know 5 days and horrible thing is I didn't lose a single pound
 I don't know
 let's say I didn't have hunger so I didn't eat and didn't seem to affect my body at all
 well I seem to have developed some horrible neck pain and
 that's made things doubly difficult the second thing is that I because I'm always plagued by these horrible nightmares they're actually just actual events of actually happen to me just replaying over and over I am an internet addict and I just put stuff on YouTube or or whatever on all night long and you know I frequently have loud loud sounds so I don't sleep that well and I have a horrible horrible that at the moment and live in a very noisy place
 why do I live in a noisy place because I have been unemployed as I told her underemployed as I told you when I don't have money to live in a place that should be the equal of all the hard work I've done in my life
 you're looking at it you know like anybody would be my I don't feel that well I'm tired I
 I don't know just tired
 yes a couple people that I've met with have told me that I I had it
 the first time I don't know
 maybe 15
 the recurring nightmares the
 I don't know I I I developed anxiety and I freaked out you know if I think I'm going to run out of gas I get short of breath and
 I don't know in the soup I used to be able to handle anything now something stupid happens and I catastrophize it and think that it's going to be horrific so I have to talk myself out of it
 hello I've lost all the ability to trust and I'm numb to all feelings partly
 I will let you know what you said
 well you
 I think my PTSD I was fine and I had it after the eighteen-year-old incident I just fine and dandy and then something happens in the last like decade I just had hit after hit after hit and it just brought everything back up and or maybe it's cuz I'm not that busy anymore so I'm time to ruminate over all these horrible things and I've said Elaine thing I'm way worse now than I was after the you know escaping from a serial killer I mean
 kind of kind of pain in the neck I'll literally
 I'm not being healthy I will
 you know
 drink a couple things of alcohol which I don't I don't know something's wrong with my heart they told me and
 so any more you know even if I have just one causes a lot of pain and stuff or I try to do stuff to relax or you know if I'm having a really really bad day I might
 I might it myself or hurt myself and some other way
 threat because after you after you do that releases all in all you're all freaked out and then if you hurt yourself you got really distracted like how come you know this really hurts and then you don't really think about the horrible thing that was in your head anymore you're thinking about I've got this
 I have tried to get help I can't get any help now I don't have any insurance I can't I'm not poor enough I would need to go through all of my retirement savings and be penniless to get any free help so I mean I'd like to be a normal person again and I'd like to be happy I'd like to be a functioning human you know like I used to be
 no
 I don't have the money and nobody cares about you know lower-middle-income class people
 you know I've been to a zillion cerum not a gazillion but you know I don't know 15 therapist maybe over my 30 years or whatever it is been sometimes you got somebody that's good
 and I found that the younger the person the better actually like a cup one when I was in law school I went to see someone or when my father died when I was 18 at the same time that other thing happens I I saw some students they were actually the best ones the worst ones seem to be the ones that are like in my age category or older cuz it kind of checked out and they just want somebody who's there but in terms of like I don't know how I did that young MD whatever think it was called once and
 I'm really work sometimes you get a new gets like wants some therapist said to me you don't want to kill yourself you just want a different life so when I am suicidal I just think of that sends I don't want to kill myself I just want a different life so is sometimes you get a nougat but you know generally it hasn't really saved me yet
 do I have to I just did sometimes you get us a good therapist oh one thing I learned is that most therapists are actually more screwed up than me you know I may seem screwed up to you guys here but you know at least I used to be able to function I was somewhat successful and I I've never intentionally hurt people I don't screw people over I'm not dishonest in my work compassionate and I found so many therapists you know they live their little teeny lives in Suburbia or whatever the heck they're from and they're totally incapable of
 relating to anything that's outside of their world
 I haven't been as I told you so but I did go I noticed that it was fun to go somewhere once a week and have somebody listen to your for Tales of Woe although sometimes it got frustrating the person was not helpful
 really happy
 I've been trying to cultivate it the last night I was on the bike path and I looked around at the beautiful nature things and there were briefs literally seconds where I had it and then him some aggressive bike ride or somebody else to come along and that would be destroyed but otherwise more than perhaps a brief second or a couple of seconds
 I don't even know I don't even know oh oh oh
 it is good
 oh my God are you even listening
 I don't think you're listening very carefully you like some of the strings I've had
 people is that what you wanted me to tell you about I
 I don't even know what the question was anymore to tell you the truth
 sorry
 no just the empty silence that I'm supposed to be filling to answer or you
 what was the question
 I don't know sometimes therapies helpful sometimes it's not
 show the happiness that was a question sometimes I've had half my happiest moment was when I climbed up inside the Great Pyramid of Giza that was extremely hot I don't know it's just wonderful
 wonderful feeling I'm claustrophobic so I was proud that I made it through there and it was just an amazing sight
 Cassius is a test to see how one reacts when there's an uncomfortable silence
 am I supposed to be pushing the button for the person to come in now
 all right she did stop talking
 I thought it was a test of how one reacts during an uncomfortable side
