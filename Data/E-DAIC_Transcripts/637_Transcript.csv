okay
 I think I got it
 what year Buick Minnie Mouse so that were okay like that
 okay
 okay
 and then
 and right now she can't answer any
 yes
 fine
 San Francisco
 the beaches fire pits the ocean movies entertainment business the different areas as
 the weather
 it's really difficult to get around by bus terrible not having a car
 that's the hardest part you can't really do all day without a car
 in every way
 by bus I do
 my most memorable experiences
 what do they study at school I studied I'm sitting acting right now is what I'm doing
 I'm studying acting and I'm working a day job that doesn't pay enough money so I'm trying to find additional day jobs or I don't know how to I'm trying to figure out how to live with joy
 that's how to live with joy that's when your life flows is when you do more of what brings you Joy that's my current
 dilemma
 I think my dream job would be weighing 70 lbs less and being a really emotionally diverse actress so I can play comedy roles which is easier for me and too heavy drama rolls which is more of a challenge to be vulnerable and to open up emotionally kind of what I'm standing right now and I would look thousand percent better cuz my hair would be long
 I really am thinking I don't have a family anymore my father passed away and there's no relationship with my sister and a very poor one with my mother so it's almost like not having any family anymore
 sometime
 take a shower
 pretty good
 I guess it was a couple months ago and
 I was a friend that kind of flipped out on me
 that would be the situation
 I wish I did handle it differently
 infidelity
 that's a good question
 the hardest decision I've ever had to make well I had an amazing cat and
 if you can imagine it was more than a cat it was like being a very large entity in the body of a cat and my cat passed away and I had to I wanted to have a proper burial at an animal cemetery and have a memorial service for my cat and my mother was against these ideas that was too much for a cat and so it took me two and a half months to come up with the money to find his casket and to decide on what style of casket I wanted because it was so hard to own that decision when I didn't get any support over it
 but eventually I triumphed and I found an artisan in Tennessee that makes Cedar chests and he made me the most beautiful Cedar casket octagono
 octagon all with Ivory lining and plush padding on the inside of the casket and the people at the animal Cemetery said that in 20 years of business they'd never seen such a beautiful casket and they'd never seen someone that gave so much to their animal
 so I felt really really good when I saw the way that I was sort of like a sending my cat and I went to the cemetery
 then I get erased from my memory I think I have erased a lot of events from my memory
 well I probably had a lot of them
 weird experiences
 definitely
 no
 well you know I'm a very determined human being so I work myself into being in positive states of mind but overall I think that definitely realizing I have some deep depression and essentially I just need more of a support network here in La I need to create a new family and that's basically what I need to renew a really do which is difficult because it's hard to have a family and family and friends you know people that you can really really trust and it's just hard to get around La without a car
 so I feel a lack of support in my life and I feel isolated and lonely
 other than that I'm very optimistic
 any changes yeah I walk to work which is in Beverly Hills and I walk through Beverly Hills and I noticed that even though I'm walking around nice places I'm a joyless when I'm walking to work doesn't really make me that happy makes me happier when I get to the commercial part and there's more people around and there's lots of kind of like activity and shops it does nothing for me like walking through the neighborhoods I noticed
 I noticed that I have a lot of lethargy in my body which is depression
 I'm really working hard at going to sleep before midnight and I noticed that it makes a big difference when I do get enough sleep
 I'm fine I'm just tired but I think I'm pretty fine energy-wise in terms of interacting with other people
 PTSD no
 yes
 recently
 lethargy lack of Joy lack of community lack of close bonds
 lack of focus
 support network no one to talk to not a lot of energy
 to do extra things that would you know help make your life better it's just sort of get into the struggle of just getting through the day
 and then trying to find the energy to do something to make it better
 I need to buy something
 yeah I think I know what my overall trigger what the overall thing is but it's deeper than the overall thing itself
 that makes any sense well
 I
 you guys are going to think I'm a complete whack job but honestly I'm really not I called my mother yesterday and I left her a message and at the end of the message I said I love you and that's a month since she called me which was my birthday when she called me I didn't answer but she didn't say she loves me the year before that she didn't even call me on my birthday and she said she wasn't feeling well
 and we had a falling out in November so I haven't spoken to her since the following out but essentially what I realized in November was just a tremendous amount of inability to love that she has towards me and I think it's a lifelong thing so I think it's hard for me to get close to people and to bond with people because if you can't trust your mother who can you trust and if you haven't received love from your mother
 and you don't know really how to receive Love Actually something about receiving lover
 receiving self-worth or validation or something like that I think that lack of support you know throughout my whole life regardless of how ambitious or determined I am the there's an underpinning really everyday you know of sadness about that not having a mother and so that's I think the main challenge to workout in my psyche or Soul or emotions
 something like that
 how do I cope with my emotions well I sit with them alone mainly since there's no one to
 share the deeper ones with that would really understand me there was no long-term relationships
 but I do interact with my emotions a lot when I'm turning my instrument and in acting class and so that's a big you know workout emotionally
 a couple months ago I went through a patch where I didn't have a place to stay and ended up staying with someone that I thought was the student friend she turned out to be crazy and I had to leave there and as a result
 I had to seek counseling / the Mandate of my school
 that's the incident that triggered it
 yes
 therapy is useful
 it's a reflective experience so your reflective throughout the week before you see your therapist and then you sort of start thinking on a deeper level about a seam occurrence seeing that's like what's really the issue and then it feels very look forward to having someone to talk to you that can really listen so the gift of active listening
 and then feeling of satisfaction from another human being caring
 about you your welfare and having someone to talk to you on a deeper level
" when I was in my acting class which was well I took some classes I audited some classes last week and it does moments lot of joy
 who's been a positive influence in my life that would be
 the most positive influence was my cat's Benjamin and my former partner
 and
 no best friends at the moment
 I went to UCB and saw Improv
 I'm most proud of my care for my cat
 and
 I'm most proud of my relationship with my cat and I'm most proud of that I have been making a lot of progress in a working on my career stuff and I have a positive attitude even though it's very difficult growing up with the family that doesn't give you the kind of emotional or financial support so grown up with a lot of jealousy and negativity and lack of support
 you're welcome goodbye
