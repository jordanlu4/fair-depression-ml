 I tend to be sorry and situations I'm not comfortable with our new too and I'm outgoing and places are more comfortable with
 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got
 turn the lights down low and listen to soft music
 I'm getting better over the years I think I'm
 pretty decent now compared to how I used to be
 got you in trouble yes ma'am
 due to the lack of I guess you can say controlling my emotions I have been incarcerated at the prison
 okay
 I'm not sure I don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision I ever made in my life
 probably few days ago with the girl I was talking to and I was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness
 yeah
 I frustrated
 because
 you know how you be put in a certain amount of effort and you expect
 you know the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship in the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you can set yourself up for failure or so
 you know I guess I'm just learning
 a lot of situations over Hank differently
 probably the most recent was a
 I got into a physical altercation with an inmate when I was incarcerated and that made me that's what sent me to prison in and I had to do a lot more time
 and if I handled it differently
 probably wouldn't ever want the president and I probably would have been home a lot sooner than originally happened yet
 tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory are several events I wish I could erase my memory
 probably
 My First Girlfriend
 she did something really extreme it wasn't necessary my eyes and it and it could have cost me my life I think that that that's a recurring thought that I wish I could completely erase memory along with the good memories as well
 a few YouTube fights shootouts getting job getting robbed
 you know those things I think those inhibit me
 I guess to explore certain areas of life that I'm not comfortable with south of the few things that he'll be nice so I can erase it completely
 yeah
 hurting people I didn't need to be hurt emotionally especially
 few women in my life are my past
 probably put my mother through certain things that shouldn't have to go through along with my close friends and family as well
 tell me about your relationship with your family
 used to be Rocky growing up but as I got older mature and Discerning spirits that I've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it is pretty decent this is pretty soon
 I would say my mother
 yeah mother
 oh she she she had her share experiences negative and positive I might her the struggle she been through
 she she she has experienced difficult economic hardship growing up but that didn't stop her for raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her Masters in just just overall being a good person and she also about her mental health issues as well and probably not the best of family that she could have been raised with social so she's kind of like a inspiration to to me and other people as well so I Was Your Mother
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 it's not easy so yeah it's not easy
 I can tell you I've always had sleeping issues why you should just take like over counter sleep medication or NyQuil but it makes you drowsy the next morning so it looks like it's a negative effect really
 the medicate I don't know shitt I don't know but I just stop taking it cuz I don't like to feeling drowsy
 not good at all
 can you tell me about that
 yeah I mean I recently got released from prison not too long ago
 older now and a lot more responsibilities and I feel like my life is not worth supposed to be I feel like I could have made a lot more better decisions in my life you know sometimes feeling sorry for myself and things that I've been through and the whole nine yards so
 there
 I'm sorry

 to better my life

 yes I do actually I do
 better decision-making better tools to reflect on choices how to control
 certain situations better yeah
 well instead of just always reacting On Emotion no matter what kind of motion it is I stepped back in and then assess the situation and I'll to see what's what's the best way to to react towards situation and by doing that it has made me more mature emotionally mature and just has positive outcome
 tell me about the last time you felt
 I was laying next to a beautiful woman who cared about me and the feeling was Mutual so that was probably the most happy

 the few women that were my life my past and
 my friends are family that's about it
