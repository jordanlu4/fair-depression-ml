okay thank you
 yes
 I'm wonderful how are you
 California
 yes
 the weather is one of them I have the food and the way I everything is centrally located
 the traffic the smog
 and
 it's just gotten really really overcrowded
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes
 I wouldn't say a lot but I do try to travel at least once once or twice every two years
 just exploring different things and being able to have different experiences things of that nature and no learning new things and I'm just different cultures that I like to learn about different cultures and when you travel you get a sense of you no feedback from different cultures and different areas so I like that
 well I just came from Miami I last year I went to Miami for a week and a half it was really nice the weather was great it was my first time going and it was wonderful the people are really nice and it was really a great experience I went out there for a particular event they have something every year I'm where everyone comes out from all over and they just kind of party and hang out and meet new people was really fun
 well from that trip I would say
 swimming and the beautiful beautiful beautiful Miami Beach Waters was wonderful
 yeah it was
 child development
 well
 I've always been interested in children since I was younger my baby's had a lot so I had a lot of experience with kids at a young age and As I Grew Older I realize that it was something that I like to do so that's when I am looking to Child Development courses and I thought that it was something like that I wouldn't enjoy doing so I started taking classes and the rest of History
 I have gas it's been 15 years in August
 yeah
 my dream job
 I would say
 to become a principal
 what is something that I thought about doing for a while now and I've actually just began the steps to try to get that going so very back in school and I'm going to be taking courses I'm so that I can make that happen because it is a dream of mine thank you
 it's going to be pretty difficult there is several years of schooling that I have ahead of me and you know it's definitely going to be a challenge but it's something that I'm up for because it is a dream job of mine so it's something that I'm willing to I'm willing to do
 a little bit of both I think a little bit of both I can be shy at times
 in and out going as well but I think a little bit of both I would say
 what do you do
 I meditate I I'm a big big meditator so I love meditating I love just reading and just having nice quiet peaceful time
 oh wow I'm very very good at that very good at controlling my temper I again series of meditations that I do it involves deep breathing and just really censoring yourself to where you can feel your heartbeat and you can really feel everything in your body and it really really allows you to de-stress and to control anxiety and anger and things of that nature yeah that helps me a lot
 oh wow it was just recently actually unfortunately it was last week and it was with my husband and
 it was about
 just the way he responds sometimes to me I can be a little aggressive and we're just trying to work with that because I don't respond well to aggression I totally tune out and that's actually would happen so yeah that was it
 I felt very frustrated
 and I actually felt angered to but more frustrated and I felt fat and too because I don't like arguing so it was a little bit of all those emotions that one time
 the situation watch I wish I would have handled differently
 honestly I haven't had a situation like that and 20 years I've pretty much kind of
 you know kind of mastered more responses to certain
 stimuli I kind of got that down
 tell me about
 the hardest decision I've ever had to make while it was when I was 16 years old and I became a teenage mother I was pregnant at 16 and I had a lot of pressure from family to give my child up for adoption or to abort and I chose life so that was that was one of the hardest decisions is not the hardest decisions to make as a 16 year old teenage teenager just whether I wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager or whether I wanted to embark on raising a life when I was just a child myself so that I think was the hardest decision
 I had to make
 well I mean my son is almost 19 now so it's 19 years later and I actually am so glad it was one of the best things that I ever did by not choosing to avoid him and chew being pro-life pro-choice pro-life and
 and I have not regretted the decision that's my only child and I love him he is just a blessing he's just a blessing and I feel very special to be his mom
 I do oh yeah
 I know it's it's not easy it definitely has its difficulties I'm just as anything but at the end of the day it is really rewarding and you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you've raised become productive citizen and go out in society and start making their way and it's really rewarding it really is
 oh wow so many ways
 the first what are the first way is I actually listen to my son and I are accepted feedback even if I don't like it and I allow him to express his self fortunately unfortunately when I was little there was not a lot of conversation from parent to child it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it and with my son I give him options allow him to express itself allow him to give me feedback or negative or positive because I feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age and that's parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of make sure that you nurture that because that's kind of
 the way that they develop me now and it's really really important so I'm different and I and a lot of ways and that right
 thank you
 well
 it depends sometimes it's it really depends it depends on the time that I go to sleep it depends on the time that I woke up so it's a lot of factors I can't just give you one answer I would say that
 it varies sometimes I can go to sleep and fall asleep right away and other times I can go to sleep and it might take a while to actually fall asleep so it varies
 I've been feeling great lately I've I really have been
 I can't say that work for the last week didn't affect me you know the argument with my husband but other than that I have been feeling really good
 no I haven't
 no I have not
 you know what honestly I feel happy everyday you know everyday I wake up I'm happy because that is a chance for me to
 take advantage Carpe Diem seize the day so I feel blessed every morning I wake up it's a blessing you know because I realize that some people did not wake up some people are homeless some people are going through so many situations that are really disheartening and that's not me so I feel really really blessed everyday
 thank you
 as nurturing patient loving friendly
 kind of reserved
 well I wish that I had already completed college and had my Master's Degree and sometimes I wish I was a little bit more knowledgeable and certain subjects
 and I can change that if I could change anything I would change that those two things and also I would be a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert
 you know what no regrets no regrets you live and learn nothing is perfect everything that I've gone through has made me the person that I am today so I wouldn't change anything because I'm happy with the person that I am today
 oh man to stay in school to stay in school and to get your education and put that first and foremost before relationship even before your career I really really would have told myself to stay focused and to get a great education
 I'm most proud of
 where I come from
 as a Teenage mother being a statistic and actually changing that being on my same I've had my same job for 15 years now I'm really proud of that I've been married for 13 years I'm really proud of that happily married to my best friend of my soulmate and nothing is perfect but he's my best friend and I love them and I'm also proud of my son being the mother that I am in the Sun that I've raised I'm proud of the job but I've done and I'm
 I really applaud myself for that
 you're welcome you were wonderful thank you
