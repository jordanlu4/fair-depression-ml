 I get along real good with my sister our brother lives up north we have some communication with him but not much
 that's good
 when was the last time you argue with someone and what was it about last time I had an argument
 couple weeks ago with my girlfriend
 what much of an argument it would just
 where are you I wanted to go to dinner and where she wanted to go
 and
 the fact that
 we're living together and
 she still wants to go out on dates and I try but
 I've been out of the area for 50 years I just moved back 2 years ago so she knows wherever everything sat and I'm still trying to learn it again
 situation that I would have had different
 can't think of any right off the top
 something you feel guilty about
 I didn't understand the question
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had
 all right

 how is the weather for you to go back to civilian life I miss the military for a while the the discipline but I kind of got over there
 discipline structure
 I was a deputy sheriff for a while then I went to drive a truck local then I went to drive and truck cross country
 and that's what I retired from
 why it was

 I mailed to you
 I exercise everyday I ate good and I do just about whatever I want to do

 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 you go to bed and go to sleep all I can do is lay down and close my eyes
 and I go to sleep
 what are you like when you don't sleep well if it's too warm
 sometimes I'll wake up and it'll just be too hot I'll turn on the fan go back to sleep
 all right
