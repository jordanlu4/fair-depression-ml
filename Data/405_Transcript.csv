essential let you know and then you can let me know okay thanks
 thanks
 go ahead and move his cord behind you didn't get any way
 hi hello
 are you okay with this
 yes
 okay not too bad
 I'm from Chicago South Side
 I'm back in 1978 when I was 18
 lately not much maybe once every two or three years
 compared to the letter A
 it's totally different you know horrible weather and
 it's just a whole different atmosphere
 let's see my mother had moved to Africa
 I graduated from high school and I had a friend down here so I just thought well let me try la
 very easy actually yeah I loved it from the moment I got off the airplane
 number one the weather son is very important to me so I love the weather
 I don't know just kind of a more laid-back atmosphere variety
 of people
 and now it's my my Homebase you know my friends that are family
 that's how I like my family is here now
 I guess the small hug earthquakes
 traffic
 just basic things like that really
 I don't currently but I did throughout my life I travel quite a lot
 I just seeing seeing other cultures and seeing more history and meeting people and
 just fun at the fun of it as well
 let's see what one trip I went to England
 Ireland and Scotland and France all in you know one trip
 so that was a nice variety
 I guess you could say probably skiing in val de saire France
 that was fun I'm glad I got to do that
 that's great
 do you consider yourself more shy
 I'm kind of shy by Nature I've tried to grow out of being shy so I'm not fully shy but I was always an extremely shy child
 but now here in Culver City this is my environment and I I guess you could say I'm not really shy and in my hometown of Culver City
 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got
 to relax I like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap watch TV sometimes on the couch in the living room just you know stay at home and kind of vegetate
 pretty good yeah my tempers pretty level
 probably with my husband
 and
 I can't remember the moment what it was about
 okay
 tell me about your relationship with you
 well when you say my family do you mean
 my family from childhood or my current family
 okay well I guess my current family comes to mind I have two daughters and my relationships pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which you know going they're going through a lot of hormones and they can be kind of bitchy and
 and but I have hope that you know they'll grow out of bed and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship
 and then there's the husband which
 like I guess I could face soon-to-be-ex-husband hopefully soon we need to get a divorce but we're still together due to financial reasons
 and yeah yeah so that that's not good relationship with the husband but
 but since we have determined that we need to divorce
 we don't expect anything out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good
 well
 I guess our marriage
 I wish I had noticed early on that
 you know it was like way off from what I thought it was
 how do you say oh my God
 hardest decision
 I guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard
 well you know we were married and I wasn't content I guess you could say and
 I kind of just gave up on our relationship and now that I look back I think it's because
 I want children and he would have been happy to never have any and so since I didn't have a father it was very important that I create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so I was kind of at an age where I needed to start thinking about having children yet I was with someone who really was not into it so that I think that's one maybe the core reason why I was not content and I just felt like this marriage isn't going to work n so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not want to break up and
 and I had to leave him because I just wasn't happy and that was that was very hard cuz
 yeah
 felt like I was hurting him which which I was him he survived he got over and now he's married with two kids but it was hard to leave him
 tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
 something I wish I could erase from my memory have to think about that
 I'm sure there's something well
 yeah there's some
 I guess it'd be nice to erase from my memory a recent I'm not resend but an event in my
 recent adulthood here in Culver City where one of my best friends
 betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really need a larger home and
 we just assumed that you know that they would use my husband as their agent supposed to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home
 and as it turned out they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent and yeah that was devastating
 I don't think I've ever been betrayed like that so I wish I could erase that not cuz now you know this was back when the kids were really young
 and
 my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say
 6 Maybe
 maybe five anyway her and my best friend's daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we run into them in the neighborhood are they run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were just you know like two peas in a pod even those her their moms weren't talking to each other anymore so now they're 13 and 14 and they're in middle school together and they're still very connected in fact she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl and it's just a little awkward you know cuz now these girls are becoming really good friends
 your friends and yet I still have this
 bad memory of what her
 her mom did to to me
 that was about 1:10
 about 8 years ago
 I tried it I try to ignore it and put it out of my head which have been able to
 in recent years
 but obviously it still comes up
 anyway that was that
 not that easy I do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time I wake up and can't get back to sleep but or I finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that that difficult thing
 well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom and then
 you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then I wake up again to go to the bathroom
 so I guess that's the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there I don't know I think there's just too much on my mind running through my mind and the day I feel like I haven't accomplished enough during the day so
 it's hard for me to just go to sleep when I'm supposed to guess
 well I'm kind of used to it now so I just go on to the day probably looking looking tired and
 like I'm kind of used to feeling tired I just do what I need to do and sometimes if I'm able to if I'm at home and don't have huge commitments yeah I might just like I said earlier just take a nap or something read my book watch TV whatever
 lately have I been feeling
 kind of down
 on myself down on life
 well I have this pending need for separation / divorce
 I'm worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers you know on the verge of adulthood
 and so I worried that you know I did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance in their early childhood and now it's too late
 like I missed out on a lot of things
 and yeah I need a job I'm unemployed I don't know what I want to do with my life I know I want to do something and I just wish you know I never did finish college unfortunately because I was traveling and stuff
 so I regret that extremely
 and I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself cuz I need to
 divorce and move on with my life so now I forget what the original question was but that's the state part of the state of Mo
 no
 yes
 well
 the first time or or or recently
 the first time I guess was you know when I was in my early twenties I was just a little upset about constantly that was another breakup I had to make back then I was
 in my early twenties and I needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting cuz I
 you know it's hard because he didn't want to break up and I feel like I was hurting him and I didn't understand this feeling I was really upset
 how did that was my first time having depression so I didn't really recognize it as depression but I went somehow I had the
 knowledge or the I was able to take myself to a psychiatrist I remember I paid for her by the hour and she prescribed Xanax to just help relax me
 and so I guess that helped me get through that and then I've had depression throughout the years just so you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as I guess it's usually a relationship you know
 yeah so the most recent time I was diagnosed and put on meds that was probably about 2 years ago
 no
 money and I don't have insurance otherwise yeah I'd be happy to go to therapy anything that might help
 tell me about the last time you felt really happy
 last time I felt really happy
 I don't know I guess maybe
 when my children were born
 I guess happy I just you know I always wanted children so it's nice
 to have them
 that's I don't know that's all I can remember of that and I guess I don't remember the good times too well I remember the bad times
 something you did recently that you really enjoy
 something I did that I really enjoyed
 well
 that's the way I am
 Friday night I went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends and we
 we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house that was that was fun
 we get to
 stay in college get my degree
 get therapy trying to become happy
 yeah try to figure out things earlier in life
 like
 yeah
 stay in college and and mainly I think the mean and what it all boils down to no matter what your depressed about it seems like
 as soon as the saying goes in the
 songs go you know it's all about money the world revolves around money in
 having none that in itself is for depressing so besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life having no money as you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it so with that in mind I would definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to get a job and stick with it don't quit to go traveling and I'll just stick with a job sick with a company build up your seniority keep your benefits
 and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of filled yeah that would have been my biggest piece of advice to myself
 not much
 I guess
 just my daughter's you know there are two beautiful daughters and
 I'm proud and glad that I was able to have children some people
 aren't even able to do that you know and they try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so that's the one thing I mean I wanted five children and I always wanted a boy which I never had but I guess that's the biggest thing I can think of to be proud of
 having my two daughters
 I'm a very loyal
 friend and person that's why when that friend betrayed me I was so devastating
 yeah very loyal very
 happy was I going to say I was going to say happy go lucky I don't know where that came from very I meant to say friendly and caring and
 yeah I care about people
 and I'm interested in people
 and I care about animals as well actually that's another thing I'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian
 yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian and I'm a vegetarian because I really care about feelings of other beings not only humans but animals to in
 you know I don't think that animals should be tortured and live a torturous life just so we can eat them
 so what was the question
 remember the question
 okay
 you're welcome by
 I did need the tissue one time so that's good
 the other sister
