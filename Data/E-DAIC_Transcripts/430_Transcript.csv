looks like we may have
 okay
 I will step out when she says goodbye
 answer
 fun fun thank you
 I'm from Los Angeles
 well you can't beat the weather and I just think the familiarity of home just makes me feel comfortable here
 smog rudeness although it doesn't compare to New York it's
 people could be unbearable in their rude
 not as much as I'd like a lately I travel more in the past but not lately no
 I just think between different places and some
 learning new things funny things that are fascinating that piqued my interest
 I think spoken to your cuz I think the first time I went to New York I was quite amazed I know it says still only in America but I just think I'm being from La I didn't think anything or a city could be bigger and more how do you say ostentatious the New York but it was it was quite an experience and I didn't think any place was I
 I didn't I didn't think any place was dirtier than downtown LA I think times I think Times Square's got us beat
 too many to mention I I don't even know where to start
 depends on the situation
 I like to walk I like to I like to play with my dogs reading anything where I guess I suppose I could just sit still and let my mind go blank I know reading requires some concentration but I noticed things that I don't have to exert myself too much help him relax
 in the past I've had problems but I'm getting better
 I probably are good my roommate
 couple days ago but that happens we're friends loving argument if you will
 I'm at this roommate about six seven years ago we just kind of got moved around the same Social Circles and just got a loan
 it's cool I mean it's the he no like we do argue we have our differences sometimes but there's not one person I'd rather have I rather live with then then her she's she's cool
 how much time do we have
 is just too numerous to mention
 my I would know how to answer that
 I think breaking up with a girlfriend that I truly cared about but knowing
 going bad just wasn't going to work
 that was very difficult
 just weigh pros and cons and just thought I just wasn't going to work no matter how much love or care I brought you a relationship there was something missing and I think that's enough time she invest enough timing
 just knew it was over
 no
 so many I don't have too many regrets by things erased from your memory
 a lot too numerous to mention I don't know how to answer that
 the same girl that I broke up with shoes she was a girlfriend best friend of mine are they were separated for 4
 several years and we always had a chemistry always a friendship and it turned into something to something which you don't turn into a relationship and it hurt him currently we do not speak I wish I might regret is I wish I I would have handled that better
 it's it's funny soon as I as I get older I'm not as close but I still care for him and I still love them and I think they love me I my mother and my father both alive don't interact a lot very close to my older sister
 my older sister
 she's just strong no-nonsense she's short yet a firecracker and I've always liked that about Hershey
 Joey's help make me feel makes me feel comfortable I'm like a another son to her in a way
 supposed to depends on my stress level would have a lot on my mind
 I have difficulty sleeping and other times it just I really need to get to sleep it just requires me listen to the radio they're watching TV reading and eventually I'll get tired fall asleep
 Crabby Bill's like anybody else
 tired listless you know all the normal things I supposed to happen when somebody doesn't sleep well
 I feel good
 no not really
" well
 no I have not
 yes I have
 I was diagnosed probably about
 but five years ago
 I think I always knew there was a problem I always knew there was some I think I always knew before I got treatment that there was some issue emotionally and other things that are very hard to explain I just was tired of feeling that way so I thought I'd help
 I think just the letter g no desire to do anything motivation just wasn't there any normal person buy things up
 so should I become socially awkward which was a little bit different for me because growing up I was quite talkative
 I do
 I'm sorry figure
 got you a it does I think it does
 well
 I think the number one thing on this is what I'm amazed about the temper I think I've it's allowed me to
 two step back from certain situations not take them so seriously and not get so tense or angry and then react they could just calm down for the most part
 now it's becoming it's becoming routine initially it was very difficult
 well 5 years old
 I don't know which one of your kid there is nothing really to
 got to be sad about your kid
 my best friend
 but you were gone I would have a dry sense of humor so you know my best friend would probably
 I think the the banner back and forth is you know usually an insult but you know fall in love
 I wish I could be taller I wish I could be more inclined to play basketball so I can become go to NBA and be a millionaire I know that's all I'm realistic but honestly
 I think I regret Emily asked asked this before me so many don't know where to start
 advice would you give yourself
 that's a good one wow
 well I don't know
 but yeah that's a good one I got to think about that and I wouldn't want to answer that that's a good one usually were asked what you want you know how you feel pain in 20 years from now looking back I don't know what advice I give myself
 something I really enjoyed
 I love
 there's several things I like to do you know I enjoy playing basketball I love I love watching I love watching all sports for that matter but brings me real Joy the past few years was become a hobby of mine is is rescuing dogs fostering dogs and funding them and homes if it's become quite a hobby of mine and sometimes I find lost dogs and I'm able to find their owner and sometimes I'm not so when I tell you what there's nothing to find the owner and I just found it on her last week for a small dog I found it it was no greater feeling cuz the man told me and told me I was up
 power that was daughter go was crying when she left so to be able to give her give them back that was no school
 I think we're somebody that didn't finish high school going on to college and graduating that's something that I take pride in though I don't show it or speak about it off
 yeah you look like my friend Rachel is funny
 vines that hair
 are you guys watching me over there
 that yes you can see in another look at that was fun. I swear that girl looks like a friend of mine it's that's weird
