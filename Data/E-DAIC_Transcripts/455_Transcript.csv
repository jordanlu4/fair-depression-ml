glass is pretty fashionable
 so just give her a couple seconds and then she'll start
 okay
 hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today
 yes
 very well
 Ohio
 finish school came out to start my life
 not often now not really often
 all because my parents have both passed away and so that's my reason for that was my reason for going home
 prayer
 I've just really not a comparison you know this is warm and
 sunny and that has four seasons so it's a very different environment
 I it took a minute to get adjusted to the different culture but after I was adjusted you know the sunshine keeps you here
 I love the weather I love the fact that I have the ocean and the mountains and so many things that I can choose from and the diversity that I find here
 can to not have things that I don't like because where I am I know that I'm finding myself there so and I like me so that means there's really nothing I don't like
 yes I do
 I love being able to explore different cultures be able to meet different people have a different set of experiences and at the same time to be able to find the commonality between all types of people it's a very rich experience
 which one to wear
 I guess I'm thinking about Egypt and the wonderful experiences that I have their as I go the people and the
 warm and loving experience I have the knowledge I get to pursue through the exploring the temples and the pyramids excetera things like that
 there are so many there really are but I can think of seeing a baby in a mosque which was just really pure and it really stay with me how similar we actually all our that's probably one of the things that I remember most from one of my very first trips are there and let's see just the interaction of the people food you know incredible I love the food to
 nice
 wow I study lots of different things that studied law I studied entertainment I studied Communications I've studied whatever I want to quite a Renaissance woman
 it's just always been my way to really explore all of the things that I enjoy keeps me fresh keeps me happy keeps me alive and just allows me to be able to
 be fully developed as a human being being able to do that
 I don't have a dream job per se what I do have is a desired or just be able to be free to do whatever it is that I choose on a daily basis so
 probably more outgoing
 well I start my day out there relax because I start my day with meditation and several other spiritual practices that I performed before I move around I get exercise so that I keep everything humming everything moving and then move forward from there
 excellent. I don't really have one anymore
 argued
 cannot remember the last time that I actually had an argument
 channel is about
 I imagine the last time I argue about something probably might be related to money
 situation I wish I had handled differently
 you know I try to take each experience as they come and try not to have regrets to Hope guilt about the way anything went because they're all for me very positive learning experiences that I get to explore who I am through so I don't really see them as needing them to be different I need to learn from them or to just really accept what is
 hardest decision I've ever had to make
 don't really have a hard decision you know because I grew up and away where my mother was extremely wonderful and the way that she always taught me to know that it was my own life and so she would never make decisions for me she always taught me to say she would always say it's your life and so for me this is don't really come as difficult to make they're pretty easy to make because I've been making them since childhood
 I don't really have a most difficult decision I've ever made
 event that I could erase from my memory I don't really have one that I can think of that would be so terrible that I would need to
 erase it again everything for me is a learning experience so there's nothing really to regret or erase
 how is your day
 a very easy soon as I hit the pillow I'm out
 great a little more
 Physical exertion then normal but still great
 no not overall but again I attributed that knife credit that to the spiritual practices that I perform on a daily basis they keep me pretty even-tempered
 no
 no
 that's pretty much every day I feel really happy everyday I'm thankful I'm grateful for my life and I'm just thankful for everything that comes into
 very smart very loving very intelligent
 funny outgoing
 I probably probably what my friends would say
 there's really nothing that I think I need to do to do or to have her to be different about myself like I'm okay with everything the way it is really am
 what advice would have given myself 10 or 20 years ago to know
 to understand that everything that happened 10 or 20 years ago was important in terms of developing the person that I am now and
 so to just be able to go with the flow and go with the experiences of life in order to be able to learn how to move effortlessly through any situation that comes up
 recently really enjoyed
 I cooked a very wonderful meal cuz I love cooking
 something I really enjoy
 wow my my willingness to get to know myself through travel through exploration through practices and through the practical application of everything that I learned about people cultures places and most importantly you know the God within me
 bye
 she breathes I see
