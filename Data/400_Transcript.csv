all right
 thank you
 are you okay with this
 yeah
 I'm fine
 Pacific Grove California
 the wholesale opportunities and all the stores and anything I could ever ask for
 the traffic is the mood of the people and the unhealthy pace
 I would see I did like culinary and I did really good in art and music
 in high school
 through my own will and desire to want to get involved with the music
 no
 open up a health practice of some sort
 what made you decide to do that
 changing things in my life that had an impact on myself and others for the for the benefit of Health
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes
 do you travel
 when I have the opportunity
 buying things seeing the culture relaxing not thinking about the city
 well yeah I used to go to Texas every every year with my dad during the summer and I always wanted to stay there and live there when I went on vacation
 most likely one of these trips to Texas where we would go and spend time in the desert shoot guns and ride go-karts and stuff like that
 it was
 I'll see y
 my dad and I are not really talking that much and my mom Dust Away about 2 months ago
 I'm sorry to hear that
 thanks
 definitely Marsh I always been that way
 I just a personality that I've grown into but learning how to adjust the sensitivity and grow out of it
 sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got
 teen
 eating I like to eat that make that calms me down
 not that good when I get really upset that it's usually a problem and I have to work to come myself down and sometimes I just don't get on something and I don't stop
 sometimes but I've learned to control it to that extent now
 when was the last time you
 yesterday I was arguing about what's what kind of water we should be drinking
 oh well a difference of opinion and I felt as though my opinion was very valid even though the other party's opinion was somewhat misinformed
" definitely everyday is growing process I wish I would have handled everything differently every day which is what makes me grow and I tried to work toward
 okay
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to
 can't think of anyone right now
 what's something you feel guilty about
 find I'd I'd say not supporting my friends as much with their career choices
 I'd rather not get into it
 the raw food Educators on YouTube and raw vegan Educators and the detox therapy therapy experts have been really inspirational in the past 2 months
 well that they believed that the essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables and this is true with many studies like T Colin Campbell The China Study the sources of information that are that are very good and I think deserve respect based on you know real research
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep really easy I've almost got it down to a science
 what are you like when you don't say
 I'm tired
 I'm feeling better than I have in a long time
 oh yeah I think it's due to the transition in the diet and in no way having a placebo effect that's actually you know losing them talks and some things that I've accumulated over my short lifetime of you know toxic choices with Food and Drugs or whatever it would be
 yes I'm less tense and less irritable and I have more clarity and more control over my
 decisions in my wants versus what I need that sort of thing
 nope
 yes to some extent
 our 5 years ago
 lack of motivation and
 basically make my symptoms were paralleling that of depression
 loss of appetite loss of motivation not wanting to do anything not wanting to be social at all having fear of social situations and the main for 5
 no
 I believe I overcome to chapter in my life that was the the doctor you know taking control my health and experimenting with drugs and I just sort of took another route which was alternative and I started juicing more and just trying to listen to maybe what I needed with help of the internet and nutrition experts and stuff like that
 yes
 can you tell me if
 I believe therapy is useful because
 without looking inward or having somebody to help you to that it's very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that will just resume in the subconscious and tell you you know it has an outburst is basically therapy will help an overall health and mental health I believe fairy
 last night I made a really great vegan dinner with no meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and had a couple of my friends over and they really liked it a lot of almost converted them
 I would say
 you know I'm trying to listen to my inner conscious more than what my brain wants me to do like my brain likes caffeine and sugar or as you know my body needs something other than that
 apple
 it's very very hard it's a daily process
 tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad
 I was handling money for a business partner and they ended up short and I was to blame but it was actually my formula crunching the numbers that it made it short but they he was unaware of the change I make the formula so the blame is on me that I may have took money and I automatically felt bad about that because of my uneasy my uncertainty to the change of formula
 is there anything you regret
 no
 20 years ago I was two years old 10 years ago is 12 years old I would tell myself to
 to start eating raw fruits and vegetables everyday
 as calm and
 sad maybe smart talented
 I really enjoyed going to the Wholesale Food Market in downtown Los Angeles
 can you tell me about that
 lots of food at great prices you can eat and feed a whole family for a third of the price is going to a normal supermarket
 so I really get a lot of enjoyment of teaching people how to maybe better themselves especially food-wise what they're eating
 what are some things that usually put
 eating and I'm watching a really good TV show
 okay
 I'm insightful I cannot I can adjust to people
 I don't know I guess I'll skip that question for now
 I'm most proud of
 that's in my overall situation with where I'm at right now I could have never imagined that I'd be in such a fortunate situation
 that's so good to hear
 because I want everything I need
 sharing your thoughts with me
