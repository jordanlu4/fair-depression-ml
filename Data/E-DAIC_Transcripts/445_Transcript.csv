suffice a take off your top will she do it
 okay she's kind of hot that's my kind of woman
 alrighty then thank you
 yes
 I feel great
 I am from Los Angeles California
 the weather
 the opportunity
 and the ocean
 it's over crowded
 overpriced
 and somewhat dirty
 I have
 well it's nice to see other places in the world and to meet other people and cultures
 I worked on cruise ships as a musical Entertainer and traveled to Alaska the Aleutian Islands korea-japan and the Caribbean islands
 being in Galena Alaska and being on a small airplane and traveling in a snowstorm and surviving
 like I was on the edge of death and life but I lived
 the Arts and business
 I don't know I was attracted to the Arts at a young age and business went along with it
 are you happy
 yes
 yes
 to be able to entertain people and make them feel emotions and make enough money to have a comfortable life
 more outgoing
 I always feel feel very confident with my thoughts and I like people to know what I have to say
 I listen to music and I sit with my girlfriend and she calms me down when I'm stressed out
 I could work on that I'm not very good at that
 last night with my girlfriend
 she was asking my advice on something and as I was speaking to her she felt my tone of voice was too loud I was not angry but I was irritated that I was being told to quiet down when I didn't really want to help I just wanted to relax
 I agree
 sometimes when things don't go my way I get depressed or upset and I wish I could come down and just realized that I should count my blessings and look at the bright side of everything no matter how bad things get always look at the bright side that's my goal
 it's been very difficult but I'm working on it and it seems to be getting a little easier
 well I when I was taking care of my mother and she was dying of COPD and then it turned into lung cancer I chose not to tell her that her condition had worsened so she wouldn't be fearful and I had to sit knowing that her symptoms were getting worse but I couldn't tell her the truth and I let her think that everything was okay
 it was
 my mother being sick and dependent on oxygen for 3 years of me seeing her health declined that's what plagues me the most in my dreams and in my thoughts if I could erase that if that never happened I would feel better
 oh I don't know I try to be grateful I'm alive and try to focus on my own objectives
 and not dwell on the negative things of my memory
 my girlfriend she's a very good vibe positive influence she wants me to be a better person
 can you tell me about that
 she's since I met her she's been trying to make me not be angry to make me not feel negative and to be a nurturing positives in like man so what she's asking for is something that's going to make me and prove therefore I must capitulate
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 it's very easy I sleep well sometimes I wake up when I have nightmares about my mother or something but I go back to sleep
 that's unknown I don't know it just happens
 I've been feeling good as the my reality is I've been hit with a lot of financial problems but I'm handling them well actually
 I've been looking at it as my girlfriend is told me that I need to do this so therefore it is on the Forefront of my mind right now
 no
 no
 today when I woke up and it was a sunny beautiful day and I had a lot of goals to achieve and I'm achieving each one one by one it gives me a sense of accomplishment and happiness
 my ideal weekend would be playing music with my girlfriend is that something we enjoy to do at going out to a nice dinner of healthy food and maybe exercising and feeling good with my body and mind and spirit
 probably as a strong-willed person with a big heart but it has a short fuse and maybe complains about his own life too much
 what are some
 I wish I could not complain about negative things that happen and learn to roll with the punches and always look at the bright side
 tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about
 well one time I had a good friend tell me that one of the recordings I did he thought was horrible and I felt it was the best thing I've ever done so that and I would have don't understand how anybody could could feel that way and I didn't know if it was from jealousy or it was an honest evaluation so therefore I felt bad about that
 as it's my goal
 no nothing I regret
 I felt
 Channel 20 years ago
 I don't know
 well everything I do I enjoy it's hard to pick out one exact event that I really enjoyed
 I don't know how to put one above the other
 when things don't go my way and finances come down and I don't get jobs at I go for that I am qualified for but I feel like I'm not getting my fair chance and opportunity
 it's very frustrating
 I don't really feel guilty about things sometimes maybe if I'm angry and I shouldn't be that I feel guilty about that I don't ever want to be short with my girlfriend ever she'll wouldn't it doesn't deserve somebody using vulgar language or shouting or something so I don't want to be that way around her so therefore that I am guilty
 my achievements of my abilities to my music and my other abilities that I have and on my hard work has paid off and I'm very proud of those
 okay thank you
 goodbye
 I like her can I have her in my house to talk to me everyday
 I'm going to stop the recording so I have to say goodbye to him
