 okay alright okay thank you
 yes
 I'm doing okay
 I'm from Los Angeles California
 the food the weather in the people
 I don't know it's not too many things I really don't like about La maybe some of the bad people or some of the bad environments in LA
 I'm sure you can
 no not too much
 I only been like to Texas Las Vegas and that's pretty much it
 catching a airplane to Houston Texas like back and forth to visit my dad and going to Las Vegas that are
 oh yeah well when I was younger I used to go visit my daddy cuz he used to live in Houston Texas and I used to catch the airplane a lot and that was a lot of fun I wasn't scared that was a lot of fun and I enjoyed that
 when I went to school I study Child Development and nursing
 I know I wanted to be somebody and when I went to school I wasn't sure what I wanted to be so I kind of took nursing the LVN program first and then I didn't want to be a nurse so I changed my major to Child Development and I graduated from that
 no I'm actually looking for work I'm unemployed right now
 my dream job will be probably doing something working with the kids opening up a nursery or something my own business
 in my mind is simple but like in reality it seem like it's kind of difficult
 sometimes I'm shy but I'm really an outgoing person I'm a people person
 to relax I listen to some slow music. Kind of like have a quiet environment and maybe lay down and watch a little TV or something
 I'm very good at controlling my temper I don't like to get really angry or upset or get to where I'm going to hurt somebody
 when I really have arguments there like because people don't agree to disagree and if it's like really Petty it's like we might say it's just like my opinion and they don't agree with my opinion so we argue about that but it's like nothing really big or anything like that just stupid I don't even remember
 when you feel guilty about
 probably not working right now I need a job
 yes
 maybe
 I don't really remember a situation I've tried to really think before I really handle a situation and I try to handle it in a my best positive way before I really do something I regret
 being with somebody like a guy you know if I want to continue a relationship with them or just be single
 my relationship with my family I don't have
 I just really stay with my dad and I have a daughter and we just stay close all my family there either in Houston Texas or they're around but I don't really socialized with a lot of my family
 my dad
 because I live with him right now I've been staying with him maybe about 5 to 6 years and
 he's just the only one I really look up to I don't really have nobody else around me to really look up to and
 that's it
 she's in a fifth grade she's graduating she's going to the 6th grade and I'm kind of excited for that
 you find it easy to be a parent
 sometimes is easy but sometimes it gets a little overwhelming
 the hardest thing about being a parent is being a single parent
 it's just you always have to have somebody to bring you Joy I enjoy always doing things with my daughter is just about making a lot of sacrifices and just always is brings me so much joy being a parent
 well my parents when I was younger they lived apart so my mom
 I don't know I'm I'm a much better parent cuz I'm more interested about what my child wants to do I'm involved in her life her every step just I'm really fully in my parents wasn't really that involved you know they had a drug problem so it just at the mature a lot faster than a lot of other kids
 so
 it was
 just
 my parents and
 their drug addiction I wish I could erase that from my memory
 now I cope with them well but when I was growing up it just was rough it was very rough had to do a lot of things on my own they wasn't involved in my decisions in life you know I just I didn't know how to really grow up and be a kid and which way to go or anything is just was like I was in the world by myself
 yeah
 all is very easy asleep will every night I couldn't sleep anytime I sleep very well
 a little sad but most of the time I'm very happy I'm just not happy with where I am in my life right now
 not really I really I try to think very positive and try to do whatever I can every day to look for work and just stay positive and focused
 no I haven't
 no I haven't
 the last time I feel very happy was when I graduated from college I feel very happy that was one of the best things that happened in my life and that was the last time I was really really very happy like that
 I feel like I was on top of the world I feel like
 just overwhelmed with joy just everything was just so exciting for me that day I was just very very happy nothing can make me upset that day I was very happy and when I think about that day it is it's a very happy experience for me
 right now I don't really have a best friend I really tried to
 I tried to eliminate a lot of my friends because they wasn't really making a lot of Positive Choices so right now I'm just like I really don't have any friends right now
 my personality I'm a happy person I'm an outgoing person and a positive person and a good mother
 insecurities like sometimes I feel like
 I have a lot of weight on my shoulders or something I feel like I can't get through something I can't get to the next step sometimes or just feeling down sometimes
 well I did have a friend and she was like bipolar and I tried to really be your friend no matter the disease she had but she was in a really good friend because she one day she start this being very negative and just talking about me like we were enemies and everything and it didn't really make me feel too bad about myself but it just made me pick my friends very wisely
 yeah just being friends with turn people that don't have positive things going on with themselves or just don't it just when I notice things about people that should determine whether I want to be there friend or not you know they might have bad qualities or just some bad habits they my smoke cigarettes or drink and I should notice that that's a red flag and I shouldn't be these people friends
 to stay in school stay positive stay focused and surround myself with good positive people and just stay on the right track
 well I went
 to a friend's house that I haven't seen since childhood and they
 is it a lot of people over there and they had a barbecue and everything and I really enjoyed seeing my old friends that are then seeing a long time and just being with my family and certain friends I really enjoyed because I'm really always in the house I really don't go out that often so just I enjoyed being with a group of friends and family and having a good time yeah
 I'm proud that I did get my GED I did graduate and I do want to be somebody and I'm very proud that I want to be a better parent than my parents
 thanks for sharing
 thank you goodbye
 okay
