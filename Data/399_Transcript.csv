okay move this I'm gonna move this behind your arm if you don't
hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today
 created to talk to people in the states
 I'm not a saint
 are you okay
 yes
 pretty good
 as far as my parents Ethiopia
 yes
 the beaches warm weather
 the diverse environment
 traffic
 well I'm currently in school I'm studying African studies
 how did you decide
 I've always been interested in African studies actually was wanted to help people and I figure that I can help them by trying to learn about it and going back to Africa making influence
 kind of in-between I have my shy moments but then when I'm around a group of people that Angela I'm pretty outgoing
 hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the
 interacts I normally write or I go to the beach and just sit there and play My Guitar
 pretty good I don't really
 get angry or anything like that I tend to keep it in or try to release it by writing
 when was the
 I actually can't remember the last time I argue with someone
 okay
 what's something you feel guilty about
 all the people I've hurt in the past
 can you tell me about
 well I've
 like cheated on people
 hurt their feelings intentionally
 some things I should have done that I regret now
 well with my ex I could have ended it better so we could be on better terms now and I probably shouldn't have argue so much as try to instigate so many things I probably should have just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out
 hardest decision I've ever had to make was
 man I really don't know actually
 having to see my dad go through surgery and see him suffer
 well he had a tumor that had to get removed so it's just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really don't want to be there cuz he's a really live person and he'd rather be running around and stuff like that but just saying I'm stuck in bed and was just terrible
 tell me about your relationship with your
 me and my family are very close we don't I mean they've always been there for me and I appreciate it but we've never had that closed collection connection especially since they're foreign so they don't really understand where I'm trying to come from having been grown up out in America so it's pretty different when it comes to a racial mean the cultural boundaries that we kind of Step each other each other's feet on but aside from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other it does it kind of awkward but it's okay
 I think they are out of control I think that they're learning things that they shouldn't know at this age I think that they're doing things they shouldn't be doing and I don't feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn't be doing it I feel like they're being applauded by the media there being applauded by celebrities that they follow
 and there's not enough being done about it and they're just getting lost
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep depends on the night some nights it's pretty hard some nights I fall asleep like a baby
 what are you like when you don't say
 usually creative actually when I can't sleep I'll just stay up and I'll write something or read a book and ideas will pop up
 stuff like that is usually a good thing when I can't sleeps nothing really bad cuz I'm having bad thoughts or anything like that
 I'm lately between a mix of good and bad I have my happy moments where I'm at a Giants and I'm alive and then some some days where I'm just you know just sitting there just mellow thinking
 not like my life self
 I don't know his wife's been like that weighs have those UPS in those downs but they kind of balance each other out
 no
 the last time I felt really happy was
 today
 I'm just from the moment I woke up it was a beautiful sunny day
 I went to see you some friends we had a good time went to school had some good grades on some papers wrote A good essay so pretty accomplished and I feel like my days just a good day
 my best friend would describe me as odd most people would describe me as odd
 I see a lot of odd things I do odd things I'm interested in things that most people aren't
 Just Like Old literature revolutionary stuff
 stuff about changing the world but through underground means
 no I don't I don't live a life of regret
 I never let fear stop you from doing anything
 tell me how you spend your ideal weekend
 I'm reading just hang out with some friends driving around finding something to do just go on an adventure
 things you wish you could change about your
 I don't wish I could change anything about myself I just wish I could build myself into the person that I'm truly supposed to be
 tell me about a time when someone made me feel really bad
 this one time me and my best friend got into an argument and she pointed out all the things I've done that I shouldn't have done all at one time how I've hurt people have hurt her the ways I've done them that were brutal and it just made me feel bad once I reflected on it all
 my parents
 can you tell me about
 I mean although we don't see eye-to-eye the always bring me to this realization that I need at the end of the day although I never listen to him or I don't choose to listen to him once it happens I learned from it and I'm like oh that's what my parents told me so I learned to trust them more and I learn to understand that they are wiser than me and that they do no more than me
 I'm not so much anymore I travel around the LA try to find you sights to see but as far as I don't travel outside
 I'm discovering new things discovering things you never knew were there or the Limitless possibilities
 I discovered I like I enjoy discovering new people new cultures
 new things that go against what's normal for us and for myself
 a few days ago I just drove out to the middle of the desert and I just sat there and I just enjoyed all that the desert has to offer and it was just enjoyable
 I felt free away from all this the city's needs buildings and it just felt nice to be out in the middle of nowhere at a completely random time
 feel good
 I'm most proud that I've always been different that despite how many people have told me that I'm really weird rum otter I think weird things I've always maintained my original mentality
 sharing your thoughts with me
 all right
