Minister for camcorder recording when I reach the human from
 hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today
 are you okay with this sure glad
 okay
 so how are you doing today
 I'm good Ellie how are you
 I'm Pasadena
 hi the weather I love the weather I love the people there so many things to do in LA I love La you know it's my home and I wouldn't live anywhere else
 traffic the traffic that's probably the biggest thing is getting a little crowded
 that's it
 when I was in the military at job with a lot I haven't traveled too much in the past few years but I'm looking forward to doing some more traveling soon
 what do you enjoy about
 eating eating new foods eating different type of foods depending on where I go maybe the nightlife clubs and stuff like that
 and just going somewhere new you know cuz culturally I appreciate differences so
 I'd like to hear about what
 one of my trips Japan you know when I got to Japan only stayed for 6 months but
 you start to learn more about yourself I learn more about myself as an American by going overseas and understanding that
 just because I'm American and I'm from this country this is not the only country in the world in millions of people billions of people actually live a lot different from my dude from we do and just learning to appreciate the differences you know
 and appreciate myself to
 but the trip itself you know actually 6 months is not long enough I think where you go to a foreign country for me because at the six-month Point that's exactly when I started to I really wanted to just wanted to stay but it was time to come back so then again like I said traveling food Customs just learning more about other cultures and it's real exciting this it's it's not to mention educational but
 I think it's needed I think a lot of Americans are a lot of my family members would never been able to go out of the country need a trip somewhere you know I don't know if America to really understand their place in the world
 I will probably actually flying to Japan in flying over Alaska the mountain tops in Alaska I need the mountain ranges are so huge and they were all covered with snow but it look like we were close enough to actually put our hands out of the plane and touch the top of us you know snow capped mountains I thought that was really exciting
 what you study at school I was a criminal justice major
 now I work in the medical field actually
 dream job and actors being an actor that would be a dream job
 I'll going
 tell me about your relationship with your family
 well I have one brother and two sisters I'm close to my younger sister she just had the first grandchild in the group of my siblings you know a couple of years ago so I haven't had a few she lives in Oregon my other sister lives here in the LA area my brother lives in Oakland I would like to visit I would like for us to all be together you know more than we are but we're not so we do the best we can but the relationship is pretty strong my mom she lives down in San Diego and I try to talk to her at least once a week and get to go down and see her every every now and then my father passed away in 04
 and for the extended family will usually get together on holidays Manny Thanksgiving Christmas and keep in contact like everybody else now on Facebook
 sometimes when I'm feeling
 I turn on
 I'll go to the gym go to the gym or maybe you know sometimes now as I'm getting older I realize when I take a nap that kind of helps me to relax wake up refreshed and ready to go
 how are you in control
 I'm pretty good at controlling my temper you know like everyone else I have I've got pet peeves and if it's one of the peeves that might tend to get a little angrier than some of the other things that you note in the bother me but overall I control my ankle pretty well
 when was the
 the last argument
 wow I don't remember
 situation that I would have handled differently
 I've seen I had a laptop and that I was over a acquaintance home and my laptop disappeared
" and I didn't get angrier and you know I didn't I was just really too
 didn't say much
 that's something you feel guilty about
 I feel guilty about not working out
 as often as I see it
 the hardest decision I ever had to make
 I haven't had any hard decisions I'm hard decisions
 staying in LA and not moving back to Philadelphia that was a hard decision you know I lived in Philadelphia for a couple years and I moved back home but I wanted to move back but I did and I stayed here you know that was a hard decision
 tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from
 probably the abuse my father exhibited towards my mother as a child
 yes
 18
 by the members of my family has been in the military and I don't think I was ready for college at that point so I actually sign the papers when I was 17 for the delayed entry program and winning after graduation
 are you happy
 yes extremely
 did you ever see cow
 no combat no
 how easy was it for you
 made the transition was
 more difficult than I anticipated it was strange even though I had been in the military for those years and I had really become a different type of person and it took a little while but it happens they have a thing called separation for about the last two months before you're discharged where I kind of helps you get ready or prepared you back to get into civilian life so it takes a little while but it's it's it it happens it takes a while some people takes longer you know some people didn't take us long so
 I went to school
 how did serving in the military change you
 it allowed me to mature I don't think I'm I don't know if I would have gotten that when I went to college right after high school or not but it allow me to also be on my own and kind of find out who I was and grow up so
 how have you been feeling lately been feeling great you know I I don't have any worries or complaints
 have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately no
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep pretty easy I'm a light sleeper but I sleep pretty well
 what are you
 grumpy
 irritated easily not too Pleasant to be around
 have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD no
 yes
 when was the last time
 really happy well probably last week last Wednesday
 my father
 well I mean I think one of the things I got from my father was to always be positive and it in and the level determination is basically never give up on what you want to do
 how do your best friend
 as a good friend funny
 caring giving
 what's something you did
 volunteering for a charity helping serve food to other individuals
 nice
 what are you most proud of
 my track and field trophies
