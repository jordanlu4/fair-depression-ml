okay
yes
 I'm doing fine
 I was born in Texas and I moved to California when I was three and grew up here in California
 I was yes
 I've never been back there
 I don't have any relatives there don't have a reason to go back there
 well my at my family's here
 that's one the weather is great the beaches and mountains are here
 all those things are very good
 the traffic was probably most people say it's expensive to live here who's probably talk to you
 recently I've traveled
 well you get to see new places in a new people you get to learn more about other cultures and different ways people think
 how at the end of March and went to Ecuador for a week
 I spent most of most of one day with with an Ecuadorian who only speaks Spanish and I speak very little Spanish so we got it was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him felt like a little kid trying to narrow saying yo what's this what's this is very humbling
 you're just just saying that
 and when you don't we're not able to communicate that that can be very difficult
 I'm probably more of a shy person
 genetics I don't know why
 I'm an electrician so I studied electrical construction have also saved a computer networking
 it was
 I guess just kind of circumstances I needed the work I was doing wasn't providing for the family and I knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work until so I pursued that because of the financial gain
 it's giving me a lot of opportunity
 but I don't think it's why I do what I want to do for the rest of my life
 well I'm actually pursuing becoming a missionary my wife and I are looking at moving down that Corridor in the fall for 4 years and last year we we trained in North Carolina for one year and that was like Theology and Bible training
 basically God put a desire in my heart to get Beyond could be on myself and and do something for other people to to go in and learn about another people their culture and to share the gospel with them
 all my immediate family
 I have my Mary have been married for 10 years this June and we have four daughters and then but I have one older brother
 how no sisters
 to what what do you want to know about my family
 I'm really close with my wife and my daughters are with my brother I'm not not real close partly because he's at he's mentally handicapped he has the mental capacity of a 7 year old even though he's he's five years older than me so just kind of because of that Dynamic it's hard to have a close relationship with him by I'm pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents
 I tell you my I use fashion high school he was a real real positive influence and me
 just he has a
 he has a drive in his heel for for pursuing the truth
 and just a
 studying the Bible in and because of his influence that kind of put me on a path to wanting to study the Bible
 I think I've gotten better at it there have been times when y'all get angry and
 yo it can just kind of really rule over me just the frustration and I'm the type of person that takes me usually it takes some time for me to get angry and then some time to to calm down again but I've I've learned over time that really getting angry and keeping that anger and doesn't it doesn't attack the other person or the thing that I'm angry at it just kind of attacks me it's a really it's not a it's not good behavior to to keep so wet when things anger me I tried to like talk to the person saying it was at this situation is making me upset try to can't talk through it and in resolving come to a resolution even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root of the problem
 well a couple weeks ago or made it as me being a month ago my wife and I were going on a trip with with her parents and her parents had already left it we're just driving down to Orange County area for this trip and my wife wanted what she had said expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things we packed and but hadn't really and in my eyes had Express that clearly but her eyes she had and so when I was trying to meet those expectations she knew I didn't meet him according to to what she wanted and then she became angry and so from my perspective I was doing what she wanted and kind of getting attacked for it so so that I I started yelling at her and
 and we know we have that conflict but then
 yeah we're within an hour so we kind of talked through and we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was
 are you asking the moment of during the conflict
 very ill just very angry you know you can feel it in your body part part of the anger is play the secondary response but my initial response was that on if it was feeling attacked and that came out as anger so I would think yes or no should I felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger
 I guess it was
 deciding to go
 hum to go toward training last year I felt the guy to put on my heart that this was something I supposed to pursue my wife didn't feel that way and I
 I just feel very strongly that that was something that we should pursue and but at the same time I knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it would kind of fall apart so I kind of relinquished it and I said her you know I'm not going to make you go
 your life if you want to go then then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going so that that was difficult for me cuz you again that I kind of felt like a loss cuz I felt deeply that that's what I was supposed to do but then after I kind of gave that up then then she came to a point where she said no I have a piece about not doing this and I went ahead and pursuit at so so just kind of giving it up what was it was difficult for me
 tell you about something bad or something that I can erase my memory
 I miss you
 not sure
 I don't know I can't really think of anything very traumatic that I would want to erase I think you're good things and positive and good things and bad things they all kind of
 shape who we are and
 so I I can't think of anything that would want to erase
 usually usually it's not too bad
 are you referring to on the the questionnaire when I said that I had some trouble sleeping
 that the job a works at the
 kind of the scheduling a shifted so I so lately I've been working some night time shifts or graveyard shifts so coming home in the morning you know when it's light and it's been hard for me to sleep but it was it was mostly cuz I was staying up so late because of work
 pretty easy
 what I do when I don't sleep that I do get cranky
 I've been feeling good lately
 no not really
 no
 no
 her--no
 can't think of anything that was
 cut out of the ordinary but
 yesterday we my wife and I took two or three younger girls we took him to the park the oldest one stay with her grandma but we we took him to the park and they played and
 yeah so that those are always happy times we take the kids to the park
 I think you say I'm a family man sad
 I'm a Dependable that he can he can count on me usually might my friend I end up doing different work around the house for him cuz I'm kind of a handyman so
 so that way I think you say I'm kind of Dependable or someone you go to for advice
 I guess I would
 I guess I would like to be able to start conversations with people easier
 sometimes I have trouble just talking to people especially if they're in a group if people are 101 then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them but kind of talking to people in a group how I wish I was a little better at that
 now if it's
 okay what was it say right before that was that
 if if I'm giving a speech or something to a large group I don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing that's kind of call advisor we're going to myself turn 20 years ago I probably would have been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life
 that's about it
 think I'm that would have been the biggest difference in my life I think
 what if I have 4 Kids and
 I hope I'm raising him right I hope that
 that alarm for the mistakes that I've made I can kind of guide them through their their journey in life and I hope that they end up a little
 better for it then than me
 yeah I just hope hope kind of threw them that I can
 heal
 believe something worthwhile
 you're welcome
 goodbye
 Torrid
 okay
