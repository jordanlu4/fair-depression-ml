okay
 sure
 I'm well thank you
 Southern California
 the weather the mountains the ocean
 traffic
 air quality
 no not a lot
 time money
 I studied art
 studio art
 it was just always a a talent and a desire I had from childhood
 I am
 making a good living through my art
 it's challenging
 well
 I need it's about having the time
 and finding a niche that appeals to others while being able to do work that stays true to my own vision
 somewhere between
 I read
 I walk dogs
 I spend time with my family
 so it's very good I love my family very much and they love me very much we were very supportive of each other
 I'm pretty good most of the time I'm not so great when I'm dealing with a lot of rush hour traffic
 but it's not out of control
 I don't really remember I want to say it was probably my daughter and it was probably about something stupid little stupid thing
 my daughter is 39
 beautiful brilliant very talented very goal-driven my son is 27 he is more laid-back very sweet and he's
 starting to
 be a little more goal-driven a little less satisfied with just the Daily Grind
 being a parent is some
 very challenging in a wonderful way
 I think the hardest thing is is fear and worry for your children today's world can be very
 violent and scary and you fear for your children safety and well-being
 I'm sorry
 oh gosh
 Sprint at the close friendship you have with your children the
 the love the support the joy of just everything little things that you share
 oh
 well I'm I
 talk to my children about anything and everything we have very open communication which in my parents generation I think children were more seen and not heard
 well with my daughter my first child I was young and inexperienced not only in being a mother but naive in a lot of ways regarding life in general and I think probably most parents have regrets of situations they may have had their children when they were when they were young that weren't the best
 sometimes I feel that I should have
 Ben
 more aware at a younger age
 just just
 decisions in situations that decision to make situations you find yourself and when you're younger out of being naive and and
 I even though logically I know that it's something that couldn't be avoided at the time you know as you get older you hindsight is 20/20 is she could older you you look back and wish that you had have been more on top of your you're
 your life when you were younger
 oh gosh
 I honestly can't think of anything
 I don't know if that I would want I can take him in advance I don't know that I would want to erase it from my memory because
 I feel that we learn from everything and that there's I don't want to lose the lesson that I'm to learn from that experience
 positive influence in my life my daughter my son my granddaughter
 there's only enough an author Carlos Castaneda
 just stopped my my family has been a positive influence because of their love and support and in Reading Carlos castaneda's works I find that he
 has a brilliant mind and because I've practice some of what he talks about in his books and experience them as being authentic
 where is some people
 you know question has validity I found it he has something very extraordinary to offer mankind
 pretty easy fall asleep pretty quick
 no not really just always looking for the next two
 projekt202

 yesterday yesterday was Mother's Day and my children gave me flowers and beautiful gifts and made me a wonderful brunch and we spent the day together and it was very very nice
 oh
 is it going
 easy to be around
 friendly happy
 I would like to work on being more focused on on projects
 gosh
 probably when I was a kid you know kids can be
 kids can be cruel to each other so nothing that
 I still at this age
 take personally or are you know hold a grudge for
 sure everybody has regrets but you do the best you can do at the time and you learn and you move on
 I don't know why I can't answer that one
 oh gosh
 I read a great book the last couple days and I've been working on a new painting that I'm really pleased with this I like the way it's going
 my kids
 but the fact that my kids are are
 wonderful human beings I feel very blessed
