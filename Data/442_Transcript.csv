essentially
 okay alright you're welcome
 anytime you ready
 another day pretty well except for dry weather
 originally I'm from Detroit Michigan
 yes
 high back in the 80s
 it's been awhile the last time it's been about five years
 not even close more set back out here it's you know you had the weather that's that's that's if I'm not from prominent reason for coming is the weather
 because maybe better opportunities and the weather
 yes
 it took a minute I had to adjust to the different attitudes of the people the surroundings locations and the vast area that someone had to cover to get to one spot to another
 the weather off of Wonder Never End never snows in in in Southern California to the prospects of starting a business or becoming self-employed and doing what I like to do
 the people
 they're not friendly for no no one's friendly out here you know Becky Sandile from the and was raised in the South where everybody's are cordial friendly High when you passing the streets out here people think that you have some agenda just for saying hello in passing so that's what I don't like about Ali
 used to used to be on the road a lot I was a truck driver and plus entertainment coach driver for a several I'll Motown bands back in the day so yeah so I'm used to traveling yesterday
 well this is a this is actually a beautiful country so just doing the countryside of this in different towns different cultures different towns and seeing how they still have the rest of the country Our Lives
 some not-so-good some bad and some good message Denver Colorado for a couple years which is really a great City and then I lived in Atlanta which is a really great state where is you know you had the Southern Southern attitude Southern attitude what is everybody's friendly and and gets along and and the Sea I've been back and forth across country least 16 to 20 times so yeah it's it's been it's been a venture
 Arkansas Little Rock where I had to get into a you might want to say hi to Cason with the rednecks down there because you know I'm African-American and down there they're very pretty as you know there that southern I still have this tendency of thinking blacks or any other cultures besides whites aren't valuable people
 yeah sorry I had an incident down there where it actually turned into a shootout
 but I'm okay
 hello about that you change the time on the. Depends on what mood I'm in at the time you know I can't be outgoing cuz I do like to go to nightclubs and listen to live music live bands and I know like I said I I did some entertainment before so at clubs are more outgoing and social events more shy
 I know it's not
 meditate
 very good very good because if I let my temper get the best of me I tend to cause more harm than good time to the person time to myself by you no physical altercations or going to jail so yeah I'm very good at controlling my emotions my temper
 good question
 okay girlfriend we just recently broke up about two or three weeks ago because of argument about what she thought she could do and what I know she couldn't do what you want to do it anyway so let your argument and argument ended in US breaking up so yeah
 emotional
 but I'm 55 and it's not my first break up so I just take it in stride in and move on
 well it's probably it's no one no no situation actually can be
 I feel at the time when you when you deal with a situation at any particular time is probably always a better way to handle it after the fact but I would say back in the day back in the 80s when me and my wife broke up I think I could have handled that one better because I was younger more hot-tempered and more irrational so I could have handled that one better yes
 what's the way I broke with the way I handled that situation well being young and inexperienced and and emotions and attitudes and not being able to communicate with another person on the level of understanding
 leaving home
 well it was like okay I'll say it was about 2 in the morning and I just decided to pack up and and and leave without letting anyone know that I was leaving that was like one of the hardest decisions that I have to make it
 sketchy loving for sketchy my family is in Detroit and Atlanta Georgia I mean California La I have no one out here so I'm basically on my own and I've been on my own for a long time so we communicate and we talked and send Christmas cards Thanksgiving cuz you know and that fact but as far as
 family is
 it's sketchy
 no one
 I don't know most things that that I don't want to remember I don't sew and I have erased a lot of things from my memory or place them in the closet which I can't open any more till to remember that so but the most thing that I can say is I won't go into detail on it but I answered netware
 because great bodily harm to a person
 in the last two weeks with the I've had this heartburn problem so in the last two weeks has been really difficult for me to get some sleep that's why I have a I have in my pocket right now I have a lot of times it's keeping me pretty sedated right now
 irritable
 and just need to get things done and I feel like I have a people and things that's against me and trying to block everything that I'm doing to secede and that's been a great disturbance to me
 yes it is but you know what like I said I take everything with a grain of salt and I keep pushing because you can't stay mad or vengeful at any one person or anyone think too long because it doesn't accomplish anything so I have to keep pushing
 I know basic I'm still the same I just just keep my I keep my ideas that I need to do and try to accomplish what I need to accomplish
 post-traumatic stress no
 yes
 back in 09 to 2009
 crying a lot not trusting suspiciousness of other people so what and I was recommended referred to a medical mental health facility for treatment
 off and on yes when I feel depressed and feel anxiety building up in me yes I still have to
 yes because I get a chance to express some of the things that I normally don't express and I can acting like blow off steam or blow off a part of my depression
 I don't know really really happy when I was really really happy when my girl that just broke up with came from upstate for us to be together rest when I was really really happy and then that's turned around within two weeks but at that point in time when that happened I was really really happy
