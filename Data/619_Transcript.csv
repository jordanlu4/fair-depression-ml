 go ahead and process but then I'll come back and I just want to make sure she doesn't
 okay
 okay
 okay alrighty
 yes
 I'm doing well
 I'm a born and raised in Los Angeles California
 I love the weather the diversity of the people that are here and just a sense of Entrepreneurship that you can accomplish anything if you're from LA
 the smog and pollution it definitely it is extremely congested and maybe too much of the Hollywood persona
 not as much as I'd like to but I have traveled a bit
 sing something new I would like to see everything that my eyes can explore so experiencing new cultures and new environments
 okay the last trip that I can think of that I went on was to North Carolina which is somewhere that I lived before I went back to visit for a weekend and it was kind of like a party welcome home back time and then I came back to LA
 having my children I was I would probably be the most memorable experiences I've had I had both of my children natural childbirth without any medication so quite memorable
 in high school I was in a music Magnum I was a dancer and I sang a bit but primarily dance and in college my major is business with entrepreneurial I don't know I've stopped in college right now but I want to pursue business
 what do you do now
 primarily stay at home with my newborn baby while she's not a newborn she's 9 months now and I just work part-time mostly from home
 my dream job would definitely incorporate helping people on some type of platform may be working for a non-profit but where I could really juggle and balance being at home taking care of my family and incorporating that with providing a service that provides income
 I consider myself pretty outgoing
 I make direct eye contact I'm not afraid to engage in conversation with people I enjoy meeting new people and conversation so I think that just really being willing to actually go out and talk and Explorer makes me all going
 I have my mother I was raised with and my sister will 10 years younger than me those remind me dear family and my own family as I have a 12 year old son a 9 month old daughter and my boyfriend is my current family that I live with and I'm very close to my family
 I do like to read sometimes it definitely listen to music same thing just try to get my mind away I enjoy all types of music or sometimes I play games on my computer or just playing with my kids
 needs Improvement for sure I think that I displayed too much email emotion be a good or bad so I was have a little bit of a temper
 the last time I argue with someone was over the weekend and it was with my boyfriend and it was really about contemplating breaking up and moving away from each other
 in most arguments when I reflect back the main thing that I wish I would handle differently is not losing my cool controlling my temper I wish that even In the Heat of the Moment that this is the temperament and type of communication that I use
 I guess making what I feel like our bad decisions not being able to provide enough for my children or not feeling like I am where I'm capable of being a should be at this point in life
 I feel guilty about not making the right financial and career choices at this point in life so far
 I also feel
 the hardest decision I ever had to make was
 whether to go to a memorial for my aunt or to work that I guess in retrospect wasn't including but really it was a decision for me on business or family and I chose family and it's made me
 really really be more aware of my family and not let a corporation or a job control me
 I would say
 an event or space or something I could have raised for my memory would be a 911 the whole experience of 9/11 and I wish I could erase it for the entire country
 yes
 I was 19 years old when I'm in the military
 I got being born and raised in Los Angeles I kind of feel that a very free spirit and I'd say maybe hippie personality and when I graduated from high school I just felt that I wasn't reaching my potential and thought I could help myself by trying to establish some discipline I thought that was something that the military put off for me and it did
 I am happy that I did that that I served my country and that I actually enlisted
 yes kind of I was in Saudi Arabia when 9/11 happen and ended up serving as
 support for the air portion of the war was being it's his was being it happened it was happening from Saudi Arabia
 not very easy I think that was a very very hard time or scary time to be away from my family my son was only 12 months when I left 13 months when I left at the time it was very hard to adjust to get back to establishing trust with him again and just from being gone for 4 months it was difficult to readjust with such a big thing that had affected our entire country and in the entire world
 after the military I started working for the restaurant industry I became a restaurant manager and eventually a training manager and ran I'm training for a restaurant for for the house and back of house employees all aspects of the restaurant
 I think it made me a lot more
 aggressive I don't know if that's the best word to use may be confident I'm very aware of eye contact paying attention to detail and timeliness things of that nature I'd say the positive factors of the military are being very disciplined and again paying attention to detail
 lately I've been pretty hard on myself I haven't been working much just taking care of the baby and I'm really really trying to figure out which direction I went next in life howling forward
 I don't feel like I have been as positive as I used to be
 I feel like I need a lot more encouragement I feel like I'm a lot more needy and clingy Than I Used to Be however at the same time I've been isolating myself a whole lot more than I usually do
 it depends on what's happening with my daughter if my baby is awake I'm awake when she sleeps I sleep
 tired of probably a little cranky as well
 you know I've been talking to a therapist for about the past 3 months I have not had a full psychological evaluation but she definitely said I was just playing fine of PTSD depression and anxiety
 yes same therapist again says that she feels that I'm experiencing signs and showing signs of depression
 definitely what I had my baby 9 months ago really happy lately I can't think of an exact time or experience
 my grandmother has been a very positive influence in my life my mother have expended a lot of strong women I look up to have been very powerful influences on my life
 my best friend would probably describe me as a free spirit
 very loving loyal
 and a
 I don't know maybe I'm predictable
 well on the 4th of July I took my baby out to the park and just played with bubbles I know that's a little but that really makes me happy spend time with my kids and just being in the moment and being still and feel like I have no needs to be met just enjoying my time with my children
 I am most proud of Taking Chances even though I think I'm hard on myself sometimes I think I've been very courageous I joined the military young Ace I left my family I moved to different parts of the country by myself I most proud of myself for Taking Chances
 goodbye
 okay
