I was just wondering if she doesn't look like anything like the actual yeah like a virtual reality thing yeah
 k
 okay k
 okay when I'm done okay
 and please
 are you okay with this
 pretty good
 New York
 I moved to LA in the 70s
 but I asked you what I lived a lot of different places
 I guess every few years but I travel a lot so I've lived in I've lived in Africa is Lyft in Spain Switzerland Hong Kong 2
 what do you enjoy about
 different cultures food music rituals of everything the smells of colors makes you feel alive
 excuse me
 one of my trips
 I lived in Kenya for about a year I'd say I love horseback riding so when you're viewing other animals when you're kind of Disguise in the scent of a horseshoe can approach the animals a lot closer so it was great seeing red orange ball sunsets and riding along you know seeing somebody animals yeah
 in Kenya
 probably when I went to a
 messiah Village and I happen to I used to live in Hawaii and I had been to Tahiti and I was wearing one of those perils that are hand-painted and I had it tied over the left shoulder with the Twisted one or not and I happen to enter a Maasai Village for the first time that day and I looked all around in the men were wearing their clothing exactly what the same Twist on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed Maasai and
 and then they came back and gave me what appear to be some very large what looks like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings and they would have liked Wade my ears straight down and and then gave me some bracelets and then they had me wear something around my waist in the city now you look proper Maasai
 so but I I just I have a lot of fun I think living getting a chance to live in different countries around the world I'm just you feel alive all your senses are completely you know I woken yeah
 I think it's not so clear-cut I think a lot of people's are a hybrid of both I mean I think I can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely Brazen and very courageous and other times probably one of my best virtues is I'm very gutsy person so when I really feel passionate about something I Risk Everything To Go Achieve it sometimes I believe that
 usually will I make decisions very quickly and I find that I have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how I can make decisions quicker and I told him I said well and that you should case you always have no choice in this is what do you mean there's hundreds of choices and I said not really because it's got wise is only one and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting all of it when I get why she always know what the choice were you really want to do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a 98% chance of failure even if it's a 2% chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield your joy so I always go to that ass tits to me a waste of total time and energy to even think about another Choice cuz who cares if you remain unscathed but it wouldn't yield to no joy
 sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not
 Departed
 you said you put your fish
 what do I do when I'm annoyed
 I don't want to annoy sometimes like it's because sometimes I can have like it needs to be a little more patient
 I guess you really have to put yourself
 and somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy
 how hard is it
 not really I think that's the reason why I enjoy traveling so much cuz you're putting other situations where you're forced to to understand other people's lives a lot more regardless of how different they are from your s different situations I've been to so many third world countries and lived in so many different situations that helps create that which is why travel is really the best education there is
 when was the last time
 my sink
 last time I argued about something
 go try to remember
 oh is he goes when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy and something
 oh I know what it was
 it was somebody who belong to the
 Scientology face
 I inherited
 I inherited possibly of a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus and I sometimes even right now I had like skin rashes welts and everything and I am very photos sensitive and
 I had an you know what episode where was I had a big flare up and I wasn't really feeling well I felt flushed and everything and the scientologists tells me that I needed to be audited and and he said something about are you aware of past lives and I had told him that I was Buddhist and I was kind of curious that if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed be able to talk to them and he said that are you aware of that about something in your past and I go yes I believe that many religions including buddhism's and Scientology believe that things that you have
 had in your history sometimes a statue or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness resulting from even your past relationships or your parents can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and we also believe I said that you know that you had the power of each person as a god-like or Buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself even when I'm on the verge possibly and I probably get one cold maybe every 15 years I don't have a tendency to be sick at all and a large part of it as I think when I think I'm on the verge I take the sort of like and I did this even when I was a child when I was seven I would fall down I have my boo boo and I would say I would say I would have two good part
 you know help the bad part of a simplistic way in terms of a child and I would actually even when I was in a very severe car accident where I got cut by glass my whole back I contradict healing an enzyme when I went back to the hospital the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that she has hers last week or back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so I believe that but
 but I was just I think I'm annoyed and irritated because the scientologists told me that because he had taken 20 or 40 courses and he had the certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and it wasn't even matter I said of whether he was really took 20 40 courses of whether I've been practicing Buddhism whether it was for 5 10 15 20 years of weather of somebody been practicing some type of Christianity for 50 years and Benny sitting in a church pew every day doesn't mean a person could have never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has you know so I just was thinking that is the antithesis of
 somebody who says they were lighting but it's just the way I guess he kept grabbing his
 you know his face down my throat that after while I was pretty patient with a but then who it was so Papa's that I became irritated
 especially when he kept telling me that I was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery the following week and I didn't point it out him cuz I just didn't want to get into it but one could say hey you have a bad hip cuz you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get hip surgery I mean I believe to some extent things that can be caused by people themselves and then he flippantly said while you wear a Scientologist believe that past lives can also affect you know what I'm thinking to myself Buddhist of all religions
 kind of like well known for being believing in in a cause and effect and past life situations and I found my thought you should really read up if he's trying to convert other people from other religions so but you know I die you know I I I just didn't you no care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it
 but other than that I mean I don't
 sometimes to have a little more tact I guess when when in terms of patients
 I can think of that right away I guess disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital
 I'm sorry
 how did you do
 my brother was supposed to be the strong and supposedly because he is in the medical field so my sister and I said well you know he's a medical one so he's probably used to seeing this all the time but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after you know my boss my father kept me know you know bucking these body would actually be fighting the artificial respirator and what kind of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard but you know I was after while the
 you know even the Physicians and even the pastor from that particular you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he did his brain function would have been you know legible
 that was
 tell me about Nevada
 I don't think I really have that many things that are that traumatic that happened to me that I've
 had to block them I really don't know what it is within my makeup which
 doesn't make me feel like I need to like I don't keep the I have friends that have on mitigated issues which they're not even aware of that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger their hatred or their fear and for some reason I feel blessed that I don't have to like I can't really even think of something that I mean I've had some bad situations happen to me but it's not that the some reason they traumatized me in effecting you know my behavior where I would wear I block at that I'm not aware of something or I hold residual negativity for some reason so I really can't think of anything I mean does bad things that happen I know that they are but it's not like I feel like a necessary for me to block them because I've been able to
 you know
 chaps that sometimes they were unfortunate things that happened
 pretty easy I can usually make my sleep by Self sleep in any situation if I have a 1 hour flight to San Francisco I could just kind of lean against the window where the pillow have a blanket over and even on our flight pass out before the plane is even taking off from the ground so I can I have literally when I've had little sleep and I very at high energy so I don't really need that much sleep but say like if I'm in Africa and I
 Bobby potholes unpaved Road and I still need side I need a few moments of sleep I was just prop something up put my elbow against the window and say I think I should take a nap for 15 minutes go like this and through the jostling I could just take a nap for 15 minutes so I don't really have that problem
 okay pretty okay me and I could deal without the skin flare-ups but you know from the photosensitivity and all that but other than that I'm pretty good spirits
 have I ever studied what
 I can still couldn't hear you I'm sorry
 have you noticed any changes in your
 I've ever studied changes in my behavior was the word
 enough
 I know I just with friends and everything just even this past week just seeing friends that I enjoy being with and just having great meal laughing just having a good time listening music
 designing your address
 regret about my entire life you man or are you talking about just recently or what are you talkin about
 you know what's funny I find that lot of the negative experiences that are in my life that have happened are falsely been
 opens up experiences that are
 that are also great that I have not overlooked root sample I got totally ripped off by my business partner to the tune of my old my whole savings ever had to start all over again and sometimes people say to me like are you sure you're okay or are you just pretending to be okay or are you angry do you want to seek revenge if I was there cuz my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each other's families which was even more difficult in a way and he still essentially my whole life savings essentially in a way and tea what got sent to prison or the FBI was involved in her pulse involved I was living in Switzerland and my father was sick and I was going back and forth and
 but you know if I hadn't get involved hadn't gotten involved with him and business I wouldn't have had there a lot of Rich experiences and I think sometimes the reason why
 I don't know why I'm such a positive person but for some reason I'm able to this not that I'm purposely trying to I do see the positive this and even harmful situations I wouldn't have gotten to live in Barcelona and Zurich I wouldn't have learned to speak as good Spanish Drummond lived in in Europe if I had not got involved in business with my business partner end up ripping me off but and there's a lot of other experiences a different friendships that I developed during that. Of time and in a way it was a total different life a different world that that would do you know that I would have never
 have the chance you know to live through if I had not been filed in my ear but of course it cost me financially and but then again I've always been a type of person who your money isn't everything and I think the one I least cared about money is when I made the most of it so there you go and resemble one of my favorite
 times in my life probably when I lived in Kenya and you would think that you know a lot of people have this really bad Vision or maybe looking living in mud dong Huts or something and living very primitively I mean it's not like that at all that I and you think that with the least amount of technological innovations and stuff like that I mean actually and I'd really didn't have you know that much been many material Goods to the time I mean I had the blast I had probably been one of the best years of my life when I was living in Kenya
 that's so good to hear
 what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago
 the same thing that I did probably when I was about 15 or 16
 to live your life with passion and again like shoes the way I was saying earlier about making decisions you have to make those decisions. Wise what will give you a sense of on wonderment what will make you give you Joy and you have to its regardless what the percentage are even if you only have a 1% chance of success you have to go to sad cuz that's the only thing that will yield you know the happiness in your life
 Otterbein your life
 the fact that I've a two-year to that and been Brazen whatever you want to say have the balls of cuts / like a harness to go ahead and follow my passions and you know I guess people called me somebody strong decisions usually this isn't sorry when you where you remain unscathed usually don't heal Joy that's just Murphy's Law Office just the way it is
 okay I think I've asked everything I need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me
 hi
