I'm pleased
 are you okay with this yes yes
 done pretty good
 how are you
 Philadelphia Pennsylvania
 the weather in Latin culture food
 music the beaches
 what's better dirty large parts of it getting violent stuff like that
 GasBuddy
 you travel a lot
 I used to in the Marines and growing up I did y'all all over the east coast and around the country out
 same thing different different types of people different types of food different types of music seeing different architecture and things like that the east coast and the west coast is very different in terms of how we build our buildings so just different places that you go you see different things like that
 turkey we visited the oldest church in the world I believe it was called the oldest church in the world they have those the towers the towers and just a different people I ate goat and some other types of food that I had never eaten before
 and I found out the people or are people just like us it's not just like Americans we might have our perception but people from another country they're just the same they just have a different language and they just look different but they don't they're not different you know
 American Experience
 I remember everything I have a very vivid memory I remember a lot of things
 I don't know
 I was a trumpet player since third grade and I did that in the mornings so I did that for 15 years of my life music
 warehousing labor
 can I ride my bike a lot
 the Los Angeles Philharmonic go to the Boston Pops Orchestra or something like that something big
 something like that to you
 Lili outgoing I wish I when I was growing up but not anymore
 the best of guy yes
 I I have music I love all kinds of music so if I just put on my headphones that usually helps or I go for a bike ride I have my bike downstairs I'll just go as far as I feel like going 10 15 20 miles and then come home that's very relaxing
 I don't have a temper I used to put it this way my daughter's mother had a temper and I started to learn it from her but I realize that's
 but that's not me that that's not the type of person that I am and so I I
 we separated and I've long since not been like that yeah
 with her only with her never never like in public or with the police or anything like that I would say that she some girls know that they can use the police
 they can just say things some girls not all girls and she would do that but no it was never I've never like hit a woman or anything like that no
 when was the last
 my former landlady I just moved about two months ago where I was before my my landlady was a drug addict she didn't didn't do anything except drug she didn't fix anything she was just lazy and everything was unkempt and and
 if you are renting to somebody else I had strong views that you should keep up with the property and I which is build up over time and I told her you know I've been here and I've given you so much money so much money and you haven't done anything except drugs and it was we got a little heated
 I I don't know because I think the way things end up
 is the right way in the end if your Zone as you learn so
 Google I said you have any regrets
 I don't know I've learned I've learned you can't have regrets cuz y'all at the end of the day you end up in the right place and that's what you have to look at so I don't think so I've learned from the things that I may have
 but I had to learn to understand I'm sure you do
 I might as well be honest I know it's looking at it I know you're a person on the other side of that but you don't look like a person but I had a woman that I was chasing and I we were intimate we were together and we were intimate and I shouldn't you know made me promise not to tell anybody at work and I was so excited and I told somebody cuz I thought I could trust that person and
 I couldn't trust that person and word got out in the hole Restaurant New and she was embarrassed and I broke her trust it was a pretty it was pretty bad but at the same time and again I said that I don't regret things because she admitted she admitted that it hurt and by admitting it heard it kind of said more
 about the situation if somebody could admit to you that you can hurt them that means they're vulnerable to which said something you know I understand that so I learned something more than maybe had I not done it had I not heard I might not have known
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to
 probably coming to California my daughter's mother and I like I said we didn't get along and I have a 9 year old daughter who I love and I want the best for so so five years ago she moved out the mother moved out here to meet her new husband and and start a new life and all that and she brought my daughter along and it took me a couple months to get money and everything together for me to do it but I knew when I came out here that I didn't know anybody we're from the East Coast I didn't know anybody I didn't know nothing about California I looked at a map and I said Santa Monica I know that City I'll try to get close to there and when it came time for it like the few days before and I knew I bought a bus ticket and I packed as much as I could and I knew that I was moving to the other side of the country
 and then I couldn't turn around that that they missed a huge step it was a huge step and I knew why I was doing it but I was terrified I was 10 I got here and I'm still terrified and it took some time to try to get everything together you know to eventually live with a drug addict that I was with but
 for sure getting up and moving and leaving everything and friends that I knew and starting completely brand new that was that was very difficult
 a lot of my childhood my parents were abusive and I guess this anonymity thing helps but yeah my parents were my parents were destructive and there's a lot of things that they did to me as a child that that I wouldn't wish on other kids
 I
 I've learned that I'm a stronger person but I
 I still wouldn't wish it on somebody else come stronger and I can help other people because of the things I know but but it doesn't completely justify the stuff that happened to you
 yes the Marines
 19
 I was actually going to go to college for music for trumpet and my parents didn't help me with any of the decisions and I didn't know how I was going to get there and
 I was so adamant about still playing though
 so I don't know I knew the Marines were something that I could do it would be physical but I could still keep playing and it wasn't going to be so
 like my parents wouldn't have driven me to college running like that and I had no idea how I was going to make that step I think I fell to the military
 was going to be an easier step so to speak I don't know if that makes sense but yeah it was more streamlined just to get in the military and keep playing that way
 are you happy
 yeah I would say I learned a lot from from my experiences
 you have no regrets you know what I mean I can definitely say that as a marine having been a marine there's nothing that can break me and I learned that for sure for the military
 all right
 did you ever see combat no thank God
 how is the weather
 not easy I would I would say that I right
 how do I join
 I went to college and pursue that path things would be considerably different
 yeah the military and one thing they don't tell you they think the whole thing about the GI bill that don't help pay for college but that's for like vocational schools and stuff like that you don't really know that and I'm not a vocational school guy
 the jobs are quite the same you kind of a little bit older and you already missed that early Windows to get in on a good career
 so a lot of people don't don't end up where they might have intended to be before they join the military put it that way
 to do after the military
 bunch of jobs different jobs telemarketing pizza delivery old phones for Verizon Wireless warehousing of done thanks and of course traveled for my daughter
 how did serving in the military change you
 what's the weather like I said no matter what comes on no matter what comes my way I know I I'll be okay and especially physically but just endurance mental endurance after sleeping in the dirt and and waking up in freezing sleeping bags and digging holes and and and sweating to no end and Twenty Mile and stuff like that
 life no matter how hard it gets it's still a piece of cake for me most people wouldn't say that
 how have you been feeling lately
 a little bit stressed I'm getting older on 35 and
 City harder to find a better job there's a lot of good in the workforce is not that that you know that this whole thing with the economy it's not as good as they try to paint it in the news there are lots and lots of people looking for jobs in a lot of them don't pay enough and a lot of them don't give enough hours and it's
 I think the economy is a big Downer for for a lot of people
 no no no I'm pretty good
 I said I'm getting a little bit better actually
 like I said I just I just learned to persevere no matter how hard it gets I'll be okay I'll be alright
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep pretty good I do sleep well
 most most nights
 obviously still pretty good I may be a little bit a tad bit sluggish but if I don't sleep for the night the next night I'll sleep fine and
 let me see all right still
 have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD
 oh no you biting me now
 have you been diagnosed with
 no
 when was the last time
 2 days ago a friend of mine
 when we fix our bikes we have to mountain bike so we got them both fixed we had a good hour or so very good high-minded conversation two things that that I understand that he wants to understand
 we went for a ride afterwards which always makes me feel good so yeah 2 days ago
 it was good
 mostly authors and musicians
 Paulo Coelho
 Radiohead sound like that
 how would your best friend describe
 intelligent articulate
 he said something about he said
 the reason I talk to you because I need to know so much
 something like that but yeah cuz I know a lot
 most times has riding my bike I just now took roughly and I like to just see if I can do that how how hard and we hadn't ridden I had with my bike in like two months so I was curious what it was going to feel like for my legs endurance and all that and as I'm writing and I got it in the best gear and I'm just cranking along on the road now you know on the freeway whatever that feels great that's accomplishment that's physical you know I'm building myself I like doing that
 nice
 yes
 still funny picture
 I know you're a real person on the other side of that but you don't look like a real person that's a shame
 but they tried
 having endured my childhood and all that and come out the other side and not be not be violent and not be abusive to learn from those things a lot of people get stuck
 I know it and I didn't I learn to turn that around
 very good
 thank you
 goodbye
 Target
 sure
 no I'm not right and not life but we
