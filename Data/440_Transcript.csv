when it's always female
yes
 I'm okay thank you
 I was born in East Los Angeles
 yes
 the freedom to explore outdoors with different weather temp out with weather temperature and climate to go skiing or to the beach may be in the same day
 I think probably the overcrowding and the smog
 I'm sure you can tell them
 not not frequently but I have
 meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures
 sure I'm the last trip I've taken outside of here was too heavily and that was my second time being there and
 I enjoyed it more this time because
 I knew what I wanted to say when I came back and and I was better prepared for
 Italians and their culturally I felt I wasn't isn't you know I was just better prepared I thought for that trip
 that would be
 being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the mist of
 acres and acres and Acres of grapes with just
 magnificent
 human development
 I actually didn't decide it first to do that I started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant and I went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant
 and through the process I learned that I had to do a long internship without pay and at the time and I miss I had a family so I had to make a career choice quickly and so the college offered
 human development major and I just went right in and used my use my units that I had already acquired towards that particular major in and I'm happy with it
 I'm currently no I stay at home I have a little one is not so little I'm preparing to go back to work in the meantime I design jewelry
 well I have three children I have almost four-year-old and then I have two older children 17 and 23
 no
 that your children that the love from them and for them is unconditional
 all the stages that they go through their stages all the time for every age
 and everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages so
 I think I'm probably more in tune with those different stages that's why it makes me crazy and I think that my parents the time that my parents were parents he was just kind of like you know is she fed is she dressed as a house I mean a roof over her head and we're doing greatest parents and we love her and so it wasn't there wasn't too much I felt that that parents thought about in terms of n terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age every year month you know and
 so I think it difference differs in that way tremendously
 fairy clothes
 outgoing
 I don't I don't feel uninhibited I feel you know confident to talk to people I probably talk
 more than I need to
 I bead I do I design jewelry that's what I do to relax
 I'm pretty good II
 well I think I
 trying not to not to feel or let others know what my emotions are when I'm upset which is not good because if I don't do anything with them then I know that some point it's going to come out and
 yeah that that's something I have to work on
 like exercising or something
 hey with my husband and it was about
 he asked me whether I thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him
 I really tired of talking about that same topic
 well it came it spawned from a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if I ever thought about it and what made me
 I think about cheating and he knows that I've been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did I think about cheating and
 I we've had this conversation a lot of times and I mean not just that but
 I don't know just about cheating in general and so I just said what I normally said normally is that I haven't cheated in that I did think about that when we were first together and I thought it was just a mere thought and
 and then his response was I know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another and that just came out
 I guess irritated me I was really bothered by that and I just started liking you know we're having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that that went into
 that argument I mean he wasn't yelling at me and was part conversation and part texting
 not talking
 at all
 pretty much any situation that involves my children and if I've yelled because I really don't like if I came to the point where I've had more of yelled it bothers me because
 I was yelled at a lot and I just
 feel bad about that and I try really hard to not
 handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset I might get and results and yelling
 tell me about the hardest
 that would probably be whether to keep
 a pregnancy or not
 yeah I am
 I was just talking about yesterday actually and
 I'll always pregnant and I had wanted I wasn't married yet and I had wanted to be married and but I just didn't think that it was the right time for me
 and I had pretty much made up my mind that I was not going to keep that pregnancy
 but I made the decision by myself and when my partner found discovered that I was pregnant he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me
 and so that decision was quite hard because I felt obligated to do so and felt super guilty to not and
 and
 earpiece
 Erica
 that was probably the hardest decision actually not know I wouldn't say that's the hardest decision I've ever had to make I'm sorry the hardest decision that I had to make
 in my life was whether or not
 the hospital should I unplug the life life support machine for my father or not
 that was our decision
 because I knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that and to have been to resort to the situation that he was in not capable of doing anything at all either speaking for himself
 was beyond who he was and I just couldn't see him
 like that anymore and he would be a vegetable I was told
 so I agreed
 to Amritsar.
 Not
 hardly ever
 too many things running in my mind
 and pretty much mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends even though I
 know that they're going to I mean I'm constantly worried about how they are when they come home and so I really can't fall asleep on the weekends most time but
 sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting good night sleep I'm just too exhausted I pass out
 but it's hard
 very stressed
 my son is is
 has been in dealing with some legal issues and currently is incarcerated and
 it's been really hard
 yes I've been probably very short Moody irritable
 well I often think about a lot of things that aren't even happy my mind just goes from when point A to point B and I don't even know how I got there now
 it's interesting
 yeah
 yes
 about 3 years ago
 my
 OBG suggested I I see a psychiatrist
 yes
 well I've in the process of changing therapist so it's been about because the program that I was in Lost funding and I lost my therapist. The therapist that I was working with and so it's been
 about two months maybe three now and but I did notice when I was in therapy. It was just an intricate part of my my life my week to see my therapist I really helped me cope
 when I picked up my son from
 when he was released
 from
 Gel
 I go get her probably you know should we use the term Hustler but meaning that I'll I'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to do what I need to do to support my family I mean you know legally of course outgoing
 maybe sometimes a little too for to outgoing for her
 and compassionate
 sensitive
 loyal
 all the things that remind me of my mother
 well yelling the yelling part was when
 just the little things that used to drive me so crazy I can see myself
 doing them and it bothers me a lot
 regarding what
 not too much really I don't know
 to go to college right after high school or not right
 and and
 that I didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy
 that are that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and not in a relationship and still be happy and
 live life
 what did I do
 I visit my son yesterday and that was really good
 I was happy that he was safe
 my children
 and
 my accomplishments in
 school and work
