 has a passion of mine and I got into school and went with it
 how hard is what
 I don't really have a dream job I don't know if that exists
 actually it's probably changing all the time
 depends on the situation
 sometimes I'm shy and sometimes I'm outgoing
 well I can't see your shoes but I like to travel yes
 meeting new people seeing new things
 exploring the landscape
 I went to Alaska
 on a fishing trip
 on that trip
 catching an octopus
 I was deep sea fishing and for halibut and rather than catching a halibut I lured in a octopus
 play golf I swim
 I read
 I'm pretty calm
 probably couple days ago but it was
 and it was about
 a musical project that was involved in
 I felt heated
 I'm not quite sure
 I'm not quite sure
 I have to think about that for a while
 I'm not really sure
 I had a bad performance one time
 and I wish people who I knew didn't see it
 because we weren't well-rehearsed and
 I was embarrassed afterwards
 I have a brother and parents who are divorced
 I'm pretty close I see them regularly
 talk openly about most subjects
 my brother
 what do you want to know
 about my brother
 I'm not really sure
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 most of the time it's pretty easy
 I drink more coffee to compensate
 fine
 no
 what is PTSD stand for

 I'm happy all the time
 ambitious a go-getter
 feisty
 I'm not quite sure
 I can't recall right now
 I went to a concert so I live music drink good beer
 yeah
 I'm a good listener
 compassionate
 and
 I'm alert
 ever
 in regards to what
 no I don't I don't I don't really don't regret things
 because there's too much else to live for to think about the past
 do you
 okay
 what was that question
 to read more and watch TV watch the computer screen less
 because that makes you have attention deficit disorder
 and you focus Less on things that are in front of you in real life
 I know
 I exercise I sleep in late
 I go
 golfing from time to time I go to concerts I go to bars hang out with friends at the beach at the pens
