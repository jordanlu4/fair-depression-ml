okay thank you
 yes
 I'm doing well thank you
 from Los Angeles
 sports Outdoor Sports mainly
 surfing snowboarding mountain biking rock climbing
 awesome awesome
 traffic
 yes
 experiencing different cultures
 well I love going to Mexico
 and it's so much different from California and Western culture so to speak I know Mexico's a western civilization but the level of entertainment than the level of education is so much different than they're like two different worlds
 traveling you mean
 I would have to say going to an island off the coast of Fiji and the name is table Aurora and it's a very small island you can walk around in 30 minutes 30 or 40 minutes and it's a place where you go to go surfing and it is an incredible visually incredible and experientially incredible place
 I studied biology
 I was pushed from behind by my father who was a medical doctor and he wanted me to become a medical doctor also
 not at all I'm working in areas of business now
 yes I am
 my dream job would be to be a missionary
 yes
 my father's initial objective when he became an MD was to become a missionary and the he's a very generous person and I think I am too I guess I got that from him hereditarily but I would like to help people and I don't think being a doctor is helping people I really don't I think it's disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket I would like to be building people homes and helping them find fresh water sources things like that if I could afford to travel to remote places like that
 screensavers
 I know it's not
 what are you
 my exercise
 I think I'm pretty good at it. I think I'm pretty effective at it
 it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend and it was about her lack of consideration
 I felt frustrated
 a situation which I wished I could handle differently
 in my later years I would say I don't have many regrets in my younger years I used to be snubbed by people and I would keep my mouth shut and I wouldn't say anything I would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior I would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings I've learned that that is so wrong and so they'll probably the last 15 to 20 years I have made it a point to vocalize my displeasure with someone's actions right away and that takes care of the anger immediately
 yes say it depends what you mean by trouble I think all the way around once you take the beginning the beginning to the end it diffuses trouble rather than prolongs or protracts the trouble
 going back it would be to not to pursue medicine like my father wanted we argued at length for many months and years about this and finally I prevailed and I didn't go to I didn't go that route but that was probably the most difficult. In my life
 there was a time when I wished I could erase a female interactions girlfriends than and their betrayals but now I realize that keeping those memories make me who I am today and and dealing with them defines who I am today
 oh my parents are deceased I had very good relationships with my parents I'm very thankful for that even though my father was somewhat of a hard handed person we came to an understanding well before he died and my brothers I get along great with my younger brother but my older brother has issues he has psychological issues and they continue to plague him and to affect me also just just knowing that he's going through turmoil
 well I guess I really don't cope with it because he's clinically depressed and he has Suicidal Tendencies and that he's not working he's very highly educated and he really doesn't talk to me and his family is very abusive towards him it's an I'm not a happy relationship for his family
 yes
 I know I would have to say my father my father is my hero he's my model he's my archetype for what a man should be use unimpeachably honest and kind yet on the other hand he was he had high expectations of me and my two brothers
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 usually it wants my head hits the pillow I am dead asleep like a log but lately I've been having just last night I couldn't sleep I woke up at 2 and I have a feeling it's because of a diagnosis of cancer that I received one month ago
 with my own personal methods of handling stress I'm okay I'm probably 90% okay that 10% comes from a uninsured nurse about the future about whether I will survive this or not
 not really
 no
 never
 never
 oh I was either surfing or snowboarding or rock climbing or mountain biking I always experience Joy when I'm exercising at a very high level of exertion
 funny jovial intelligent perfectionist
 that's no one's asked me much about that maybe
 to submerge my
 hedonistic self
 I look at it once again and my father feels my Consciousness he was the ultimate dufur of gratification he put now behind him and he put what will be in the future in his sights and he never let go of that and that's what made him the self-made man that he was or as I am looking always for the present how I feel now and it's difficult for me to slog through a mile full of crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away
 it would be
 my ex-boss and he started using my last day of work when he fired me he started using a lot of profanity toward me and I turned to him and I said you cannot talk to me that way and he continue to use more profanity until I objected to it again and that's when he fired me and that still in my mind and that occurred a year-and-a-half ago
 anything I regret oh yeah I regret not getting married and having kids
 you've done anything to a boy
 sure I suppose I could but I think that
 that would have robbed me of the many opportunities I had and I took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because that's what I enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness because the United States is not the end of the world it is once you get to trouble you find out that we are not if we do not have the highest level of living in the whole world that other people think that we're the only ones that think that and I disagree
 that's a good one I would say I would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and I think I've done that and I may be coming to an end soon with this diagnosis of cancer so I think I've done I've I'm happy with my life thus far
 I was giving a rock climbing lesson I have a part-time job of instructing rock climbing and many of these people have never done it before and they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives so that was very gratifying to me
 I would say my
 Devotion to the environment I wasn't always an environmentalist but I have been vocal in the cause of being a steward of the environment because today there are a lot of people people that are polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic things like that and I stand up and I have been on TV and on YouTube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment
 thanks for sharing your thoughts with me and you're welcome
 goodbye
 it was interesting
 okay
