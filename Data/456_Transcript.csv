okay
 occasion
 yes
 and well thank you
 Boston Massachusetts
 I moved to LA about a year after graduating college in 2001
 quite often least a couple times a year
 God I love both cities they are polar opposite in many many ways but there's things about both of them that I love
 I have to pursue acting and writing
 it's still not complete reality to me but it was actually very easy because of the the the the creative factor out here allowed me to pursue what I wanted to creatively and there's different the social culture was different in a way we're at from where I had grown up and it it suited me better my personality
 I like the fact that you can come here and pursue any any niche of in creativity or art or entertainment that you want to and sort of make your own path I grew up where its nose constantly and is very very cold so sounds obvious but clearly I like that it's you can swim year-round and I like that it's there's always something to do no matter what day of the week it is
 I don't like well I miss my Sam I miss that there's no I don't like that there's not a big family element here I miss I'm a big family girl I miss my family I feel like it's very crowded here but yet it's very easy to feel sort of isolated alone here
 I'm sure you can
 I can't see you she is but I do mostly just not up to much worldly travel mostly back to Boston and Florida where my parents live but I do enjoy traveling and take a lot of trips within California and around here
 I just have an adventure do something fun or if I'm going home it means I want to see my family
 oh my god well I like to drive up to Northern California go to San Francisco and family and friends they're always super super fun. In college I with my college boyfriend from Boston to eat we drove we went to San Francisco and drove down to LA and Las Vegas and that was kind of how I realize I wanted to move here so that was very that was ready I was a big one
 in general
 I guess it would be moving here I move to when I move to LA I got on a plane with didn't know anybody here and I just got I talk to a girl and I met online and agreed to be her roommate and she pick me up at the airport we never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely don't deflate out here was his big monumental
 I felt powerful and excited and just open to whatever
 telecommunications got a lots of every lot of different writing writing styles eventually graduated with a concentration in public relations and English minor
 what made you decide to do
 writing cursive writing
 writer of I guess you could say writer-actress which is but I guess writing is first
 hard very hard because you need to know he's going to push you to do what you have to be self starter you have to make it happen so it's very hard cuz I don't think that's that naturally in my personality I do but not as much as I need to
 I would say are going on in general
 pink screensaver
" I sometimes take a walk if I feel tense listen ambient music helps if I need a soothing background white noise calming
 I am getting better at controlling my temper cuz I don't usually have a temper too often but when I do and I lose my cool I have a hard time controlling it
 yes
 no
 argue with someone God
 I guess it was a friend a friend a girlfriend if it wasn't it was about our
 are each separate perspectives on a a certain situation between us but obviously very very different and it started out as something big and then we just realized this is this is stupid we don't need to be fighting about this so it kind of ended quickly
 I guess it would have been with an ex-boyfriend fighting with an ex-boyfriend relationship stuff definitely losing my temper and making a situation escalated in a way that it didn't need to be I wish that I had just walked away from it
 I don't know if I could have avoided the complete situation but I definitely could have
 May the outcome much less
 chaotic
 I guess that would be
" walking away from somebody who was definitely bad toxic from my life
 kind of sort of growing out my coming to a point where I have to say I'm going to do something that's really really hard for sort of Me no short-term pain for long-term gain and I had to make sort of an adult decision relationship-wise but it was still carry over into other areas of my life and taught me that you know you're not always going to feel great every decision is not going to be easy and feel good
 are you happy
 yes
 I was kind of forced to this issue was just what was going on in life was sort of can ignore those signs just yeah
 I guess it would be a particular argument I had with somebody that happened to be in sorry about public place and got in trouble for it I wish I could erase
 mileage to my family have a wonderful family completely blessed amazing parents have a brother and as he has a little girls have a baby niece that I love more than anything in the world and I could not ask for a better family therapy the idea
 my parents for sure there's wonderful people and then stop by example and I feel like I'm a good mix of both of them
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 pretty easy I try lately it's been a little bit hard my sleeps been off but for the most part I've come to recognize the importance of it and it's it's been pretty easy
 Lig fidgety maybe a little bit out of it I might might seem like I'm in a good mood cuz I might be a little Gideon laughing more just sort of high emotions but overall get irritated faster and just sweat more just feel feel just a little off
 not really just try to be more focused get things done
 I'm just trying to focus on what I want to do career-wise and really
 stop wasting time or if you know just procrastinating and get things done and being inspired going and seeing you and being around people that are doing what I want to do and just carrying it over to my own life
 no
 no
 oh just a couple days I was just in with my family and my baby niece in Florida and that's why I went down there to see her so it was just awesome I'm always happy when I see her
 probably as very
 funny humor would definitely probably one of the first things they would say joking always a little wiseass and my personality but they would describe me as always at unconditional there for them and just
 they know they know that I'm there if they need them always
 my drive be more driven and getting things done
 I guess it would be bought a recent a recent ex boyfriend that was a mistake of a relationship
 yeah sort of just
 the they think because he the way he felt about himself certain things he would say and even though what he said didn't directly make me feel about the whole situation made me realize the fact that I'm even with this person made me feel like I'm allowing people into my life that shouldn't be there so I'm dumbing myself down and that was terrible
 yes I regret not listening to my gut instincts
 don't second-guess yourself
 great listener
 constant sense of humor very malleable in terms of people tolerant and comfortable around all
 people from just all ages race gender whatever I just I crave diversity and love to just meet him I just I'm a people person and I start everyday with a blank slate
 I did some acting work on a on a series with a really great group of people and it was it was a very cool cool creative experience by inspiring
 probably coming out to LA on my own without knowing anybody and staying here and pursuing what I want to do
 thank you
 bye
