okay hold on
what you said she should stay good
but in French
 friendship
 okay
 okay
 yes
 I'm doing good thanks
 I'm from Los Angeles in California
 I love the beach I love the weather and I love all there but things there are to do here
 I don't like the smog I don't like the traffic and that might be those might be the thing at the top of my list
 which have a little bit yes
 we enjoy packing the kids up getting them in a different environment helping them to learn about different cultures and experiencing those cultures to the fullest and just getting away
 a couple years ago we took the kids to Acapulco for Thanksgiving and it's not normally a time of the year that we travel but we thought we try something different and it was a great experience for them we did all kinds of things that we normally wouldn't would not have done so with an opportunity to sort of stretch our Horizons and experience some new things and we actually had a really great time
 one of my most memorable experiences in terms of travel I guess was the time that my luggage got lost in front of Vallarta and I spent the week I'm wearing my husband shorts and t-shirt
 I went to a fashion
 for two years and then after that I got my bachelor's
 now I'm a real estate agent that has nothing to do with the subject that I studied in college but it's as the great career nonetheless
 my dream job would still be in real estate but it might be such that I have the financial means that I can just do it because I love it I love helping people secure their first properties I work with a lot of first-time buyers it's their way into wealth management I like educating people on the process I would probably still want to be in the business of real estate I might actually delve more into income property ownership but it would still be something in real estate
 definitely more outgoing
 I have a good relationship
 I work out to relax usually three to five times a week I work out in the mornings and it does help to manage stress and in real estate and being a mom there is lots of stress in my life
 getting better at it not the best at it I tend to be very outwardly with my emotions and I'm learning to try to check them out the door a lot more than I used to so I can work in progress
 it probably was the person was probably my husband and the timeframe may have been a month or so ago and quite honestly I don't remember what it was about so that I told you that it was probably something that was not even important
 I wish that
 I wish that I would argue with my husband less especially in front of our kids
 I feel guilty about arguing with my husband in front of my kids is something that they should be apart from and separate from and not even not even be included in that
 tell me about the hardest.
 It was probably the decisions had let my daughter move forward with the heart surgery that the doctor says that she need it but it was it was a very scary time and place for us but we we move forward with it was a decision that I did not make a loan I made it along with my husband
 an event that I wish I could erase from my memory would be
 as an as a child being touched any of her inappropriately by a family member
 no
 I've been feeling fine
 I've been feeling fine this summer the work stress is still there but my kids are out of school so our household is a lot more relaxed my son is actually in Sacramento for the past couple of weeks so it's just my husband and my daughter and I and we're sort of taking a little bit of a laid-back approach to Summer before our vacation comes up
 have you noticed any changes
 no
 I'm pretty easy over the last two to three weeks I think there was one night or I had so much on my mind I just find it hard to fall asleep but in general I do sleep well
 what workouts help with that as well
 I just sort of not as social a little more quiet
 lag
 ragging
 no I have not
 no
 today or yesterday just the ability to be blessed to wake up every day and I have an opportunity to make the best day that I can
 that's that's a blessing so I'm happy about that every day
 my mother is definitely a positive influence in my life she is someone that I go to and confidence all the time she's a very spiritual woman and always seems to lead me appointment in the right direction
 my best friend actually passed away so I will I will use my husband who was a really good friend actually in at this point he is my best friend and he would probably describe me as someone who lives my life passionately who is very dedicated and loyal and who wears her emotions on her sleeve
 on Saturday my husband my daughter and I just we were in Burbank handling some business and after that it was so hot and my daughter asked if we could go to Sherman Oaks Galleria to hang out and it was not something that was my choice but it was just really nice to be able to hang out and I really casual environment and do something that that she wanted to do and I really please her and we went shopping and we had a we had a really good time but ordinarily I would have never chose that activity but because my husband and I were able to throw whatever other plans we head out the window and just enjoy her and ended up being a nice family outing
 nice
 I'm proud of my children I have a 7 year old daughter and a nine-year-old son and I'm very proud of the way that they are are growing up and that their character and their academic skills and really that the little people that they have become
 thank you
 goodbye
