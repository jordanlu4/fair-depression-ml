 okay
 gotcha
 thank you
 yes
 I'm doing pretty good happy content
 not stressed out so good
 a Los Angeles California born and raised
 well besides me and my home I love that there is so many various things to do I don't believe you can live here and be bored if you are active person like myself
 that is so overcrowded it's just too many people here people are not more hospitable I mean if you speak to someone I feel like I should speak back and I look at you like they want to do something to you or just wake up so angry I don't like a lot of our political laws or issues that we have here and the economy
 you travel
 not as much as I would like to but yes I do
 I enjoy the whole set up the whole agenda the planning the research and I find that very exciting for me I like exploring new places I never been a going back somewhere I really love that just the thought of how much I'm going to put a sign for shopping also don't return Wars and picture taking doing videos and is creating a new experience that I had never had before
 sure I recently just came back from San Francisco I've been there before but I was in one particular part of the Castro district and I explored other parts of San Francisco is one of my favorite places to go in the first place I decide to go besides putting down my luggage at a hotel would be a restaurant called Scoma's which is actually on the pier and they have the best crab cakes ever and the last time I went I saw Jerry Springer the show you no talk show host I did some shopping I actually met up with friends or some bars actually went I'm a foodie so I went to a couple of restaurants or heard about on the Food Network I took a boat ride and I've visited some friends so I really had a good time
 I have several of those but one of my most memorable experiences in life would be
 the day that
 Barack Obama became president that was a memorable experience for me and I wish that a lot of my family members who have passed on was here to see that
 that would always stay with me like a tattoo is a very memorable moment that they'll never be forgetting it'll go down in history and it is history and it's just a great experience for me and other people like myself to know that we have transition Beyond race and that will in some ways and that you know anyone can become president and really fulfill their dreams
 there's no limits
 World depends on
 okay I am a dispatch manager the last school I attended with
 and I have my degree in homeland security and investigations I work for a private security firm I'm actually over seeing about 12 to 20 people a day I worked various hours and my job is very tedious I do a lot of problem solving and it makes the night go by fast I work from 10:30 to 6:30 and within the Dispatch Center I should say a command center that I oversee we do dispatch and also surveillance so half of the night we're looking at 20 cameras for corporate and residential account also dealing with supervisors and security officers who actually are at a site and we put them in with Carter mobile vehicle or mobile van where they stay on site until the actual site is ready and develop for people to come through after construction so we make sure that we obtain and make sure these places are very
 well-rounded with security we do a lot of observing and report so any information anything that's happening on site for the the security officers they allow us to know about it I do everything from inventory to attendants talking to other locations out-of-state making sure are a data information in their systems are updated a computer software so anything you think about I'm actually involved in when it's far as the company is concerned so it's very tedious but very rewarding position
 my dream job is completely opposite from what I have now I've been writing some 36 I've been writing songs since I was about nine years old and started when I was in the junior choir at church and I've always had a passion for that I feel like that runs through my bloodstream music is is there's a song I would always say for every situation and occasion and I feel like music watch through my bloodstream is just a part of my DNA and who I am and my dream job would be an engineer who owns their own record label and a very big time songwriting / producer
 oh I'm definitely not shy that's not me at all I'm very expressive person as you can probably hear I've never been shy a day in my life but I'm more outgoing more blunt I would say
 that's just who I am I just feel like you know it's people we're all you know made up of different characteristics and personality traits and I just like expressing myself I talk a lot I get that from my father and I just you know what I what I feel I feel like I should put out there and voice my opinion like anyone else that's just who I am
 interesting
 that's a good question I listen to music but I like to go to the beach and taking the whole scenery just to smell the ocean you know water you know that that whole experience of my feet in the sand looking around just taking in the small things just you know I appreciate them Breeze I do stuff like that when I get a chance to but sometimes a glass of wine or just watching TV be having a conversation sometime praying that you know or whatever about anything that goes on with my family so it's different things I do and shopping always helps to his very therapeutic for me
 that's number one I would say
 pretty good I would say a my twenties I would have a different answer for you I was more quick-tempered I'm pretty good with that yes I do get upset and angry about things depends on what it is but I just think what when you grow and you become you know you know you get older you know not always maturity doesn't always come with age and knowledge and I feel like as I've grown as a person I'm a lot older now more calm and more centered about things so I don't get is at angry as I used to it is a better way to deal with things besides getting angry
 a couple of days ago and I argue with my ex girlfriend over the state of things in our past relationship that still bothers us both and we're just trying to get to the point where we can communicate better we say things when we're angry we're still heard about things we're trying to work through so that was the last argument I had
 there's so many of those I wish I would have handled
 a lot differently
 wow so many of those situations I wish I would have handled differently
 good question I'm sorry for taking so long it's just so many things I I think about
 wow
 handled differently
 I don't know that such a hard question but you know I can't answer that question for you
 I can we plan example I was I think maybe 18 years old and are 19 and my brother is a couple years younger than me my dad is physically abusive and he was never there for us he was the type of father who just kind of came around my mom will let him whoop us or he'll show up whenever he wanted to but he wasn't obsessed and your father that was active in our lives and one particular time I guess my mom and told my dad that my brother was having company without permission and he went over there and you beat him up really bad the only reason I knew was because I was working for my mom at her hair salon and he brought them up they're black and blue and and bloody and I feel like I had a nervous breakdown I didn't handle that well I feel like I
 I'll should have been there to protect them I hope I'm not going to cry cuz it still bothers me I feel like I should have been there to protect him and I wasn't and it bothers me and I take on a lot that bothers my wasn't there when it happened and I called social services and told them what happened and I just wish I would have took him to the hospital and I broke down and I just wish I would have been there for him and that bothers me and I just feel like I should have dealt with a better just took him to the hospital instead of going in the bathroom and crying
 and that bothers the hell out of me to this day
 just what I said about my brother
 I just wish I was there for him when it happened
 and I wasn't and I blame myself for it but I
 I feel guilty about not being there for my ex-girlfriend
 Financial at the time I couldn't get to Vegas so I couldn't be there for her when she was in hospital and sometimes you couldn't be there for me but it just I take a lot on my shoulders and I blame myself for stuff I know that I can't control but I feel guilty about that
 Barry
 about that and so many other things my grandfather Frank passed away and he was a great grandfather and I used to ask my family members when he was I don't know where he was located where he moved to new phone numbers anything and over the years I was asked what happened to him they need information and didn't tell me and then I found out years later that he passed away he was asking about me and I feel bad but I didn't know how to find him where he was so those are some of the things I feel bad for
 tell me about the hardest.
 It's a lot
 I give you one a plan example
 no I'm never served in the military at all but I can't give an example of something my mom she does hair like I said she has her own hair is what I want for Karen hair salon I remember going to the shop one day just kind of hang out with her and she introduced me to a client of hers and I remember
 the lady said oh I didn't realize you had a daughter I knew you had a son and this is the first time I heard that and it really got to me it hurt and I feel like there's no excuse for that and I didn't want her to explain and that just really hurt me to my callcore I talked to my dad about it I called him and he said I would just ignore it how do you ignore somebody saying that you don't even know that you exist how to ignore that and a part of me sometimes wish I could just erase a lot of things she's done like that away cuz it's still tends to bother me
 I have no military experience I thought about in the past I thought about it since I actually got my degree in homeland security and investigation I thought about becoming a police officer there so many things I thought about getting into but the weather like freezes on certain positions I've applied for I just went a different direction to still have to do with the type of law enforcement like what I'm doing now but never got into that
 I have no military experience I never signed up for the military just thought about it
 are you happy
 I'm kind of really never thought about it by happier I didn't enlist or not somewhat yeah
 I'm happy with the way things are I don't think the military will actually be for me it's some good things about it like paying for college tuition always having to fall back on GI bill experience of you know fighting for your country but do I think that was for me I'm kind of past that at this point I think I'm past the age limit where you can even sign up for it so no I don't have any regrets
 no
 I have no experience in that so I don't know
 I don't know if people that have been in the military like my family members uncles and aunties and Dino that are still here or not here anymore
 never been in the military so that's I can't answer that question
 I don't know I just heard about it but people have been through after they come by the military but I have no idea
 overstressed
 happy at moments
 feeling sometimes to feed it
 and insecure hurt I spent a lot of time alone
 is it by choice no but
 good and bad
 not great
 yeah happy a lot of times when there's moments where I'm really really sad
 is well too so they don't really balance each other out at all
 not at all I do so much tossing and turning 4 years I don't remember last time I got a good amount of sleep until recently when I bought this Brookstone pillow which is been helping but I'm still tossing and turning and then why can't I play there I want to go to sleep and it just does not happen and I don't know why if it's my stress or what's going on but my sleep patterns are not great and I still get up and do I have to do like I paid 9 hours or so so that's just me
 active like I am now completely Wide Awake some days I'm fatigued and tired and a little sad but usually I'm just up and just being me and active and overly bubbly and a busybody
 normally usually
 yes in the past over 10 years ago I was diagnosed with that
 yes
 couple of days ago
 I felt really happy
 well sometimes you know in life because nobody's perfect and there's things I get to get out of it get to me sometimes you put the weight of the world on my shoulders and we take care of everybody else sometimes you get lost in that transition and I just seen I'm happy to have everyday I thank God for every day I live and I'm at I'm up and I'm able to work and do things that I need to do for myself and I do you spell happy and rested and I caught up on shows and I relax and I ate and I just had a good day of a peace and Tranquility which is not
 it's not a regular thing for me is kind of weird to have those kind of days cuz it's so much is going on
 oh that's easy my grandmother
 she's been passed away for about 20 years now 20-plus say she's been the backbone of who I am I'm so much like her as far as hard work and determined strong-willed I mean just the glue to keep the family together she was the backbone of our family and she's one of the she's my hero she did everything she you know she was so selfless she put everything on the back burner but everybody first you get what I mean because that's what I'm doing to I know I get that from her just you know endless caring and loving I never had to question that and my grandmother even she was a rare commodity a real real person of so much goodness and I just appreciate everything she taught me he would pay for our public school I'm sorry for a private school and help my mom and my dad when they first got married years and years ago with a second car will pick us up everyday everything she could to help and was there for everybody and then some she is a great example of a
 but you know I'm a human being that went beyond the Call of Duty to do everything she could for her family and she's my hero and I'm really proud and honored to be a part of her bloodline and I miss her dearly
 how is your best friend
 I don't have one
 but if they if I did have one I would say that would say that I'm a loving person I love hard that I'm creative and funny articulate down to earth very blunt a good friend and I value friendship you know and I made a mistake sometimes you piss me off I can be a little mean and be sarcastic but overall a good person that's just too hard on yourself
 and doesn't get herself enough credit
 and gets taken advantage of sometimes because of how nice I am
 if I had one I was thinking it would say that
 oh that's an easy one shopping I went to the mall and I shopped I shopped online I had so many packages coming from high heels tennis shoes to jackets and cute very creative sexy dresses so shopping puts my mind out of everything that we talked about as far as my feelings of hurt her insecurities all that goes away cuz shopping is therapeutic and once I get an idea in my mind and coordinating colors and I just know what I'm doing this and that with I'm very creative and in I like things out of the norm so that just makes me if I could shop all the time that would be a drink
 nice thanks
 my accomplishments with school me being out on my own for a long time I've been on my own since I was 18 19 years old and I've been able to keep up my own place and I'm very responsible I pay my bills before I do anything else for me and I am very particular about paying bills and that's just always been at the Forefront to me to make sure to my house I was okay before I do anything else so I'm proud of my maturity level and my responsibilities
