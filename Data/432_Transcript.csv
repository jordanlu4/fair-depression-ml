 6 months ago
 nice of pace
 photography job
 are you happy

 I love you weather
 cool people
 relax you just talk to you
 nice environment
 crime when you go through some sections
 done my share
 the ability to
 capture events
 be a part of it be apart of exciting things like
 Olympics Games festivals
 special shows
 meet new people
 which one
 Canada
 it was nice
 a very refreshing clean environment
 all the people seem to be very light-hearted but you able to do serious work
 I love the landscape
 I think was riding on board an Amtrak train
 liberated
 photography
 hi I think I'm doing that job
 I really believe I'm doing it not very difficult you know not at least not for me because I think up some natural inclination for it
 I know I connect with people
 I must try but I'm forced to be outgoing because I and I can't really get anything done being shy but given a choice I'd rather be you know
 a little more full back until I do not talk I feel like just the closest a safe part to go
 so that kind of cuddles with my spirit of Adventure sometimes I think
 example
 well an example of what exactly do you mean what aspect
 okay well example like traveling sometimes you want to go to a particular place
 and it's a
 something great happening there is no such a great place but it's not such a cool place to go like take them some like Boston I used to go to a lot now you know everybody I talk to you a little bit nervous whether they should go there you know to do you know I have a great time we think is that a good getaway spot still right now sound like a fan
 how many I
 I take walks
 I called the friends we have to something
 I think I'm pretty much got that under control
 it's probably something silly in a work situation that last about five minutes and pretty much having fun again I don't really dwell on
 negative things too much
 I don't have any regrets right now
 I really can't think of anything right off the top
 Brown decision I've ever had to make was off
 not hiring a good friend
 for a job that you know they weren't qualified for
 that's hot
 I am because you have to explain to them that it's not to Friendship you're hiring is still competent
 my father
 I just saw
 taught me how to
" you know what
 and be able to see the right side of any situation you faced because it goes away in a few hole in there long enough and I are found out to be true so
 it's okay except for somebody off
 distance siblings you know I don't see you as often as I can
 I was just you know when you've been your travel quite a bit you just don't see people go spending it always there you know there's nothing like yeah
" well you know I'm I get pretty excited if I'm working on something on developing something so I tend to overlook the time sometime but other than that you know when I write them out
 well
 I guess I'll be a little bit off
 I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get sleep you know as soon as I can. Thank you for the try not to be grumpy or anytime just probably filled up at night
 I feel okay now
 changes like what
 well I actually am I hopeful future ICU
 I see a lot of new things unfolding I mean from that perspective yes
 nope
 never
 I feel okay now
 I went to Great parties last week
 that was really cool
 well it was like on a rooftop and a lot to really are nice people who are basically in the same kind of a mindset are pursuing the same type of goals
 I know it was all quite inspiring actually I got a lot of information I know a lot of good connections were made
 awesome guy awesome absolutely awesome
 party weekend
 is a
 cooking my own food relaxing
 you know I know if I'm in the mood for company yeah I have friends in
 family members join me
 well
 I kind of like to put on more weight sometime but that doesn't seem to work
 are you like crazy and nothing happened
 well you know I charging people in general sometime
 Miss Mystery do you know if you kind of like her
 if you look different now you're in a different type of a different set of things make you excited or you're into a different way of thinking people tend to misjudge you you know and that used to make make me really be upset sometime but yeah I'm kind of figured it out and I'm pretty much over that you know so I see it as their loss not mine you know if they didn't get to know me you know that's hey maybe they don't need to and it doesn't really bother me I'm kind of work those things out in time you know
 yeah
 are my best qualities Pocoyo
 listening I think
 Honda
 maybe just talkin you know how the conversational level
 sometimes people tend to burden me with everything they got because of that but you know
 I guess it is that's probably why it seems I come to the tough so when I when I see too much of that I just saw pull back
 go for your dream
 believe me what you're doing
 don't let anyone discourage you and you'll be okay and that's the way I feel now that it's kind of evolved itself
 postpartum
 I think my alarm
 my my my kind of spiritual relationship you know I might Mike my settlements about
 not being too too anxious about
 but things are going around me and being able to see that you know there are no mistakes that really happen
 and you shouldn't really eat never lies have to be defeated I'm proud to be able to have arrived at that point in my
 my my thinking my friend work. I think I'd save me a lot of problems that could have been differently
 anger questions
 bye-bye
