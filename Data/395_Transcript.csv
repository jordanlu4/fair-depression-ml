 and and they're they're great kids

 no I think they're there it's challenging it is more difficult because their stepchildren so there are some times when I'm not sure exactly how much to get involved and how much not to get involved but we're very lucky because they are really good kids they do tend to fight a lot but
 but I but it's not as difficult as I think some other parents have it
 what are some ways that your
 and your pet
 I made it make a make a conscious effort not to not to punish them or over punish them I make a conscious decision not to scream at them the way that I was scream. I was screaming a lot as a child and it was really it was really difficult so I make sure not to do that
