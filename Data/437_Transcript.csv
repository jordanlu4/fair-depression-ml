 probably more shy but the that sometimes I could be outgoing
 I'm more shy in terms of being alive. It takes me it takes time for me to get to know people I mean I'm not a real party person I don't like to go to parties and meet people and things like that but if I'm among friends and think like that but I can be for the outgoing

 spending money for
 it was a I felt it was time to move on with my life and to buy a place for myself so I could be self-sufficient and independent

 and then I could erase from my mouth when I when I was when I was student teaching for a year trying to get my teaching credential undiscovered I never enjoyed it I want a race that whole year 1983
 it just brought back horrible horrible memories of what I went through when I was student teaching in the discovered that teaching K-12 with no not for me
 I stood my major was Spanish and linguistics
 what made you decide
 I was very good on languages and I thought them I enjoyed taking them and I was just having a good time taking foreign language and I was getting good grades so I thought maybe this is what I should go into foreign languages
 I was teaching I was in the Delta teacher teaching English as a second language for 30 years and I just recently decided to retire myself
 I have a pretty good relationship with my family with my mother and my sisters and my father passed away in 2008 and my relationship with my father wasn't as good as with my other family members

 last time I was really happy
 I probably when spring break came around and with a vacation time and it was time to go on our trip
 yeah it was a it was a week trip up to Central Coast to Cambria and Pismo Beach and Santa Ynez was just the nice getaway relaxing on the hotel lawn and garden drinking wine and enjoying different sites and eating good food and then buying were going to replenish our dwindling Supply at home
 I think she would describe me as a kind and sweet and motivated and nice person
 oh sometimes I wouldn't mind being a little more outgoing I guess I tend to be more reserved so I wouldn't mind being more outgoing towards strangers and things with
 really badly about myself probably when I betrayed a confidence with some friends of mine when I take them when I tape them singing Christmas carols and I I played it to some other people and they found out and they really laid a guilt trip on me for doing that
 but it all got resolved at the end we all we became we were all hot it was just a bad misunderstanding on my part but it worked out okay
 probably having done what I did bikes playing at the other people
 what advice would I give myself 10 or 20 years ago and don't give up just keep keep pursuing what you want never never give up with CU does a hint of a disappointment if nothing if it doesn't work out
 I'm a I'm a good listener I'm I'm a motivated person I'm hardworking I'm conscientious I'm caring assembly a pretty happy type person
 something recently when I really enjoyed
