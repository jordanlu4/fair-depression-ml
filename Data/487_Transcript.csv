no hair is all messy
 Doug and she's going to start
 okay
 hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today
 yes
 I'm fine thank you
 Detroit Michigan
 yes
 I moved to LA myself in 2007 but my family came here many more years ago more like 40 years ago
 how often do you go back to your hometown
 I don't go back to Detroit anymore
 I really don't like the weather and I really don't have any reason to most of my immediate family is out here in California
 compared to a
 completely different
 for me Detroit was just very cold it wasn't the best for my personality I prefer La more open space warmer climate warmer people just a different different vibe that I that I like better
 after my husband and I relationship ended I have family out here so I thought it would be easier to start over here than some of the other places I have lived or just stay where we were at
 extremely easy I came out here every year to visit while I was in college so I was extremely used to it plus I had also taken 6 months out of off of school and lived out here and it went to school out here so I was completely used to it
 like I said the weather is number one and just less crowded it's more open space it's a comer friendlier Vibe less rushed
 this morning would be one and when I drive to traffic in certain areas it can be but in general
 there's not a lot but I don't let's like I guess the overall threat of earthquake but that's isn't really that much of a factor cuz it rarely happens
 the price of real estate that's another one that I don't necessarily like
 I'm sure you can tell.
 I can't see your shoes I can't see your shoes at all
 so I don't travel as much as I used to
 but I have traveled worldwide
 new experiences
 well I used to be an international flight attendant and then later I traveled through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so I traveled a lot of different places and
 how to say they were all pretty much enjoyable cuz you know there's different cultures different things to see do learn enjoy experience
 my experiences I was saying
 Europe visiting more so I've also visit it in South South America yes cuz our cultures are so very different
 I was probably say more shy in general compared to people who I know are really really outgoing although I've had them describe me as outgoing
 what I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got
 I like to read I like to walk or power walk or hike
 listen to music
 I'm very good at controlling my temper
 oh probably when I was married with my husband many years ago it could be many things I don't even know a specific but just anything in general pretty much could turn into a debate argument with him
 it could be it could be your choice of
 some of the instances when I might have been with him and I you don't got emotional or let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than just you know saying it is not something to respond to perhaps but it was always be where you were also pushed to answer so you know you can always just say ignore a person there cuz many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate but some people
 you know what don't respond to the so-called Norm if you ignore it they'll just so you know deescalate but that's not always the case I taught middle school kids and you can try call message with him but that doesn't always work but you always have to use the teacher maintain you know your professional demeanor so you can't really even when you know the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or the kids so
 well if I could be
 several
 my guess it is Susan in
 long as my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way and in that case she died so
 I know that's a pretty hard decision cuz you don't know but you also know if you don't but it could be very serious outcome for them as well
 what about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase her memory
 oh many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second-guessing things that you might could do but they also can be learning experience is so is it necessarily a good thing to erase them you know if you can look at is positive sometimes people can have a strong reaction and don't really look past the impact of the event cuz there might be something that
 you can gain from that
 but there are a I grew up in a home of dysfunction so there was
 just domestic abuse you know and
 there were many incidents is so you can't just say only one cuz there is lots of traumatic things but it also would have been a different outcome and say learning to deal with some of the things that occur in life is an adult that sometimes I see among the acquaintances or friends that have not had really strong experiences fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so
 you can listen you know you can and I cuz I understand that not everybody's had the same experience you know you can walk them through levels of understanding and you know as you know someone you have a balance of background information on which to help them pull from in to see that you know things will progress in a better way knowing that this isn't like the end of the world or is terrible as it seems that it could be and you can also relate other experiences of things at work worse or you know seem to be and of course is always in general I mean when you look at all the calamities in the world
 you know most of those things aren't affecting us or the people that we know here
 so that provides as perspective that you know can pull someone out of there
 I don't necessarily say self-absorption but the seemingly intensity of their experience right at the moment
 well we have a good relationship day for the most part there are different levels of stress and Trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it is made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others some of not had
 as much
 experience in life that will help them deal with things you know in a different way so it's always evolving and I walk and positivity as a lead of you know the way I respond to try and engender more positive response from them rather than feed sometimes the very strong reactions are responses or any reactions that they may have
 pardon I didn't I didn't hear you could you repeat
 my mother different teachers friends
 can you tell me about
 well my mother is always been a very calm person for the most part easy-going even though she's experienced a lot of negativity I've had teachers that have been very
 talk positive and proactive and have you know taught independent thinking and techniques to rise above some of the things that were occurring and just very close friends that you know I would see handling situations sometimes more much more more difficult you know dealing with things so
 it depends for the most part it's you know pretty good it depends if I'm dealing with a lot of things or studying or you know trying to get more hours in the day cuz me to get things done then you know it's less but in general I don't have a problem sleeping it's just if I make myself stay out stay up because there's more stuff that I want to get done
 I've been feeling okay but less you know stressful and general it goes in general cuz I've got several projects that I'm working on so but in general good
 like I mean. In particular I mean I just seems less stressful as I get more stuff done and the stress comes from sometimes are being a lot more things to do in a short. Of time but you know reorganizing some of the things that need to be done you know can smooth it out
 have you ever been to
 no I haven't but I know it's something that a lot of say veterans are particular how people have
 I have not know
 well there's several I guess
 and happiness comes in small or large things but in general everyday everyday everyday every moment to me is I mean every day every morning is great wonderful you know your happiness as far as big celebratory kinds of things I don't have big highs and lows like that I think it's something that should be on your Continuum you know it everyday it can be a really great meal it could be a great view it could be you know a moment shared with someone you know so
 this should be an even on an even keel
 as perseverant you know I will continue for sand and positive upbeat
 is there anything you regret
 maybe not doing things differently when I were younger or like spending my money differently or or spending my time you know a little bored differently but that's hard to say it's like okay as your kiddos or you can see you know you could have done some things differently
 instead of buying the house I did what if you know waited and bought another one of me things like that
 I would have made myself moved California sooner and I would have
 instead of buying the house that I bought then if I known I would I would have you know the situation I have now waited to get something different but you know how can you you know how that hides out you make the best decision that you can After Time
 with the best information available you know after you have looked at several options
 being independent and educated able to take care of myself
 thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay
 albino
 okay
