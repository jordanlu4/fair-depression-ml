yes
 Los Angeles
 convenience convenience
 people the crowd
 traffic
 people that lack of respect
 locally originally
 meeting old people I love talking old people
 I work a lot with my elders in my reservation and other reservations here in California and I spend a lot of time with her with the elders I talked with them and they helped me out of
 Target are good stories
 going in the mountains and seeing waterfalls then no one else is saying except for my people and I was the most beautiful thing I think I found
 it depends on the situation if I'm if somebody comes to me looking for me to help them I take control it if I need help with its I work at asking for help so it depends on the situation
 I Garden
 and I think
 very good.
 3 days ago it was about communication and the lack of communication on the other person's part and I needed them to communicate better so that way I could understand and they didn't communicate so we had an argument and I got to settle
 I felt I'm caught off guard because this is an individual that I spend pretty much almost every minute of my day with and to not be told what was going on in this person's head and then to have a situation arise and I was kept out I didn't like that
 I got a pass
 probably lack of time spent with my grandparents
 just wanted on you regret that you didn't miss time with spend time with me
 I want thing I truly wish I could remember I was I was a professional athlete and what time I have party till like 4 in the morning and then I had did my event at like 10 in the morning and I was my captain and I'm very smile team
 that's one thing I truly believe that
 are the professional fighter soon
 yeah I'm not party. About other people besides myself
 I studied massage therapy and Nursing degree
 a lot of it's just been on job education
 I'm very
 I'll get to my own injuries I just going through the therapy process and believing in people and seeing how it worked and I decided to do that I wanted to help people too
 are you happy
 oh yeah
 yes
 I want to paint that's all I want to do is just paint
 I have two sons and it's time for me to the move on and they're older and they can take care of themselves now so many leaving the area where my sons are sweetheart
 the reflection of you
 play reflection of you a mind you so much about yourself Who You Are
 consistency even when you're sick
 I don't assume my kids are right around by listen to him first and then make my decisions after that and I try not to come from an emotional hiding place but I think logically and I put myself in their place before I do it we discuss we communicate happy in my family cuz that's the only way we get along with each other through communication
 communicate
 my family is severed pretty much so my family my relationship with my family on the reservation is very tight and the rest of the family were all fragmented scattered around the Southwest so it's not very tight at all
 I have too many to count
 start with my uncle my uncle was like my dad. Me to go away
 he watched out for me he told me he taught me hard work at a very young age he also taught me to protect my family
 Tommy honor. Me Love
 it's a good man
 how easy is it for you to get a good night
 I don't lie ever had a good night sleep in years so I have to get broken sleep
 are dreams the dreams you come through real
 get up and go to the bathroom and go back to sleep
 my years of fighting and just got up to me
 reserved
 reserved and I try to find things to distract my brain to think of different ways of doing things
 I got rid of TV about 8 months ago so I got rid of that distraction so what I do now is ready to paint a garden or cleaning house washing dishes or get out the walk that's nothing to do a lot of walking out is
 anxiety anxious
 my anxieties
 habits good I have techniques to bring myself down
 nothing new
 out of the normal
 yes
 3 years ago around 3
 insomnia issues
 it was about
 2 years ago around there to look it over two years ago I was released from therapy
 off the therapist Release Me
 what I noticed is I still deal with pictures and emotions
 what would I do is now if I really practice hard at taking care of myself and then getting to those places to things that
 strike me give me anxious or excited or angry I learn how to work out of it and realize it's not real it's not real
 that's just the emotion it's not real so these are the things like no manches and I tell myself and this is really helped me a lot from therapy because it taught me that those emotions and pictures truly aren't real
 and that's the therapies helped a lot that mean it's just a change my world
 if
 around the same time as the PTSD
 after years ago
 in my dreams when I dream I do
 last night
 I just dreaming of fighting and then in preparing fighters to fight I wasn't nothing to I build up anxiety dreaming about preparing fighters to fight and then stepping in front of thousands of people and then I always end up fighting in my dreams so it's always what gets me scared in all my dreams is that I should have made the move and finish the fight and I didn't
 and so builds anxiety and stressing me that I tend to act out in my sleep
 I was real like I was there right like I smell taste feel everything their house there
 on this morning driving here talking to my girlfriend
 trustworthy
 he loves me I love him he's more best friends
 a 02 change
 I can recall
 okay
 I got it
 just not spending time with my grandparents and in
 I think they today issues maybe you know a couple here there that I should have went to the store first or something like that but I mean it's nothing like that
 quit thinking you know it all
 my loyalty
 my trustworthiness
 the new art project yesterday
 nice
 where is Santa Barbara from the film some rocks and some old rock song Someone that made by loving just threw a dump old rocks out of the way and it went through the pile of rocks and I found the soul rock that was in the middle of it and then took a home and now I'm doing art piece on it and for me it was like the thing was totally forgotten about was just considered a rock and now they're sure you'll be sitting in my grand kids table and let's just give me a call like that
 what are you most proud of in your life
 start starting something that I'm so bad at
 then I don't think there's no way I can be good at it and all sudden I get to be better at it so I don't even have to think about it just so good at it that way I could just touch it and feel it and then I think about it these are the things I'm proud of like I like that I like that
 accomplishment I guess you can say
 her her left clavicle needs adjustment
 her clavicle set tired makes it look like she's been in a car accident and she's like this sheet her left shoulder is up higher and it's question so you're off and it's drawing my attention to that so I don't know if you guys noticed that to the other part of it too is the hand motions that she does some of the hand motions are very aggressive in it and wakes it was very distracting in the beginning because she was like
 fast moving like my therapist cuz we working with the PTSD issues he that he did everything slowly cuz I said off on quick trigger movements and so like with her hand movements like that. Like this talkin it was distracting in the beginning but besides that everything is just like it's pretty amazing computer but it's and you feel comfortable that is a good thing
 yeah yeah
