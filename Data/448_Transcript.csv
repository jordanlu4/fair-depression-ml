okay great thank you
yes
 doing pretty good
 all I was born in Brooklyn New York I came out here when I was seven and I've been here ever since I don't consider myself anything but Oak California
 I'm a welder
 I just I don't know it was something about making and Building Things and repairing things that intrigue me and I was actually pretty good at it so I stuck with it and and that's my profession
 T I really never had that I've just kind of always hope that I would have a job that could support myself and my family and I was satisfied with that
 well I just recently lost my uncle and he raised me since I was 7 years old and other than my wife I don't have any more family he passed away last July and
 starting to get over it I knew the day would come but he was my last living relative so
 I've been depressed about that and I'll but I'm doing better
 it depends on the atmosphere if I'm around people that I don't feel comfortable with kind of reserved but if I'm comfortable and I feel like I fit in I'm not going
 screensaver
 right
 I enjoy old movies old while it's called film Noir and I love those old black-and-white movies and I get on Netflix or Amazon and I try to pick a movie that from back then people were different than day I don't know it's just a different era and I enjoy it
 my wife says I probably is not as good as I think I do but I've got to admit sometimes I lose my temper and it is according to her over things that I shouldn't be losing my temper about but I'm working on it and I have basically had this problem ever since I was young child
 oh yes
 I've been in and out of trouble with the law when I was much younger I'm past that point now but you know when you're young you think you know everything and you know you never going to get old and the future doesn't matter but it does matter because everything that you do when you're young follows you for the rest of your life and
 I don't regret things that I've done but if I could go back I definitely would make different choices
 me and my wife we we don't argue we disagree and it's she's very strong-willed and she's a match for me so we go back and forth but we don't get violent and we don't say meaningful things or hurt each other we're just she is a determined strong-willed woman and I am who I am so we kind of go back and forth and
 lately I have been the one to bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because in the long run it's just her and me and there's nobody else more important to me
 when I was younger I wish that I didn't follow some of the people that I followed and what I mean by that is no running in a circle with a certain people I am having an ego bigger than my common sense and that's what got me into trouble I was an only child and
 I kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and
 getting the girls to laugh or having people think I was going to cool or whatever you wouldn't think that now I'm kind of overweight involving but when I was in my twenties I was at a completely different person and
 if I would have had some brothers and sisters I may not have thought or acted that way but I was an only child so
 I
 you know where and we're
 people thought I was cool and that got me into trouble
 tell me about the hardest decision I've ever had to
 hardest decision I ever had to make was
 giving the authorization to
 have my uncle passed away he was on life support and his kidneys have failed and
 doctor said there's nothing more I could do and to not have him go through any suffering
 to let him slip away
 Michigan see I get very upset my uncle
 raised me like his own son and
 never let me down
 and he's gone and
 for lack of a better word to push the button I never thought I would have to do that
 but as I said I'm getting over it and
 things are getting better slowly
 my wife she is always there for me she will always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend and she knows me better than I know myself we enjoy doing simple things it's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to but we mesh we enjoy each other's company we like the same things and we you know occasionally go out and do something together but we we just enjoy each other's company and she like I say knows me better than anybody in the enzyme it surprised me sometimes
 how is your day
 you know lately when I can't say lately if I don't excuse me if I don't do
 a rigorous activity or something that really stresses me or strained my body at let's say for a couple of days I'm just very relaxed and not doing much
 I just automatically get up after 4 and 1/2 5 hours I mean En Mi y physician now that you're not getting any sleep but I mean I don't feel tired I don't feel so exhausted I don't feel like I need to go back to sleep I'll stay up all day and I'm fine and most people will say that's not enough sleep but you know for me it doesn't affect me
 well it was some things could be different but I'm not dissatisfied I'm happy with my life that they're like with anybody else there's a few things that I wish would different and I think that's an anybody everybody else has no life but I'm content
 yeah I feel a little less motivated
 recently well I can't say recently this was back in January
 my wife and a few friends were noticing that I was becoming forgetful and I couldn't remember things I didn't see it and you know when they wouldn't everybody brought it to my attention then I started to anyway I went to the doctor and they gave me the test and apparently I have MCI which is mild cognitive impairment and I've over the last month or so
 nobody has mentioned it to me I'm a man maybe I'm getting better but the neurologist that I saw us as having me come back in a year and going to retest me hopefully it's not the beginning stages of Alzheimer's I'm still a little young for that I'm away from 52 but I was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and it could have been due also I was told by him because of the death of my uncle I could have been very depressed and I was not able to retain things and
 tell work I'm going back in a year and we'll see if I'm any better
 I'm sorry
 I'm not understanding you I'm sorry
 no no I have not
 yes
 2001
 I was in a what is the word I'm looking for I was in a
 in a state of mind of where I was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if I didn't seek any help I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder Waring and thinking too much about things and thinking the worst and
 I I take medication for that
 well you know it's not really therapy it's you know every few months you know you got to see the doctor are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription it's in alphabet you know kind of like the next person next person that is I am with Kaiser so it sits they'll talk to you but it did they give you the impression that
 you know I okay let's move along you know that they'll hear your explanation but you know they don't have all the time for you that you may want so I'm doing fine now if I really needed help I would I would do something the medication works for me
 last time I felt real happy
 well it would depend on what the event is I'm always happy when I'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and I ain't no I'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and I don't have anything else she is my world but I enjoy being with her and we we we do things together and I'm happy all the time when when we're doing that when I'm outside of that Circle
 I don't know if the sounds right but I'm not seeking happiness I I can only explain it as I'm content I'm not
 I'm not disappointed or I'm not wanting anything I'm being whatever comes my way is fine so
 well
 I don't know why I couldn't give you that answer I want my best friend is my wife but she would describe me is I don't think before I speak I let the littlest insignificant things bother me and I get angry over but the big things it's like I let it go and she's bewildered by that
 years and years ago she had a classic Pontiac LeMans and she had got into a minor fender-bender and she thought it was going to be the end of the world cuz that was my baby and I don't worry we'll get it fixed and she what she thought was going to hang or something this was as you know it was my baby and she calls you know you you get excited over nothing but you know I ate something like wrecking your car that you love and he put so many hours of work into it money
 it all gets crashed and it's like you don't care so
 that's the only way I can explain it
 well I need to lose some weight if you could say I'm definitely been on the eating beans and the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle I'm here I am this is the heaviest ever been in my life and I'm finding it a little bit harder I can't say harder but I'm finding the willpower
 just say no and stick with it and to go exercise or not you no movement now Gourmet before walking on me and my wife and we were a little bit younger we used to love going for walks and we lived in a
 hey boy you don't look at that wonder what's inside their ER at that's the way that we don't do that no more I guess it's worth a little bit older now and
 trouble heavy retarded to walk with all this weight but I I I wish I could change that because
 this is not a healthy size
 lately
 no I don't regret anything lately everything's been fine the I could say that the biggest
 biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and I never ever
 in a hundred years there ever thought that I would face that situation and I'll never forget it but
 they say time heals all wounds and and it does
 don't listen to other people
 again I'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to he would see the things that I was doing in the pads that I was going down and I constantly thought I knew better and I think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they the young lady that I was talking to in here they think they're invincible and so did I I figured I'd never going to God I'm never going to have those problems I wish I could have changed some things the history of my past follows me as it does everybody and that has limited me and in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that I'm able to do I don't miss them but if I could go back 10 or 20 years I definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions I made
 my welding certificates I'm certified by the American Welding Society and I have that's probably the biggest achievement that I made for you know myself an accomplishment
 people that I know say that I'm well I haven't been working on cars lately but they said that I have a natural knack for restoration and working on vehicles and I don't see it but I've been told that once or twice but I I've kind of
 I've kind of started to slip away from that I don't know why I can't say from lack of interest but I just don't feel the motivation no more I wish I had a pocket of money and I have somebody else to it that's how I feel
 okay well thank you
 bye-bye
 hey
 okay well I'll tell you know after a couple of minutes
