 California
 San Pedro California
 find the weather of course I really love the weather also this is where all my family lives so
 you know it's good to be around your family
 and just a lot to do out here
 I wouldn't say a lot like maybe once or twice per year
 memorable in a good way I would say having my children at three children so I guess that's the most memorable
 right now I'm just doing liberal arts so General Studies nothing specific
 I do take a lot of I do take a lot of science classes because eventually I do want to pursue education in Psychology but that's later on
 my dream job I really thought about it
 I don't know
 honestly I really don't know
 I wouldn't say shy I'm a little reserved I think there's a little difference
 oh no not really shy
 to text me a little bit longer to warm up
 I don't know I just like to read people before I really open up to them to see how much I'm willing to share
 and how much I'm not willing to share
 it's okay I mean I love my family we have our ups and downs
 specifically I guess with my mother you know is a little bit more up but I'm the only girl so it's expected I have three brothers so with that being said it is what it is it's good when it's good and when it's not good
 it could be better
 probably watch TV or you know does not got my pick up a book or something magazine see what's going on in fashion just something to keep my mind off things
 pretty good I also play games I like to play games on my phone on the computer things like that I wouldn't say I have a temper you know just average you know when things upset me I deal with them but I don't overdo it I don't you know explode or anything like that
 probably what's today Friday probably my see was it yesterday no day before yesterday actually was with my mom it's it's so funny the argument with about she feels that because I'm a mother a wife and a mother that I should not have a social life
 meaning I should be at home knitting or something I don't know so it was small that wasn't a big argument just you know I mentioned that I may go to a comedy event and she was against it I said well it's really not your decision I'm an adult so that was about it
 that's about it
 recently
 probably
 I mean thick I'll probably should have you know
 oh I know when my husband and I were discussing relocating from California I basically put my foot down and said I wasn't you know willing to do that and I probably should have kept it up in mind because there are some pros to moving or relocating but I guess at the time I really just didn't want to hear it so I just put my foot down and said you know we're not going anywhere with staying here I probably should have been more understanding because he is from
 you know he's not from California so he's probably feeling a little homesick and I should have took that into consideration
 guilty probably not spending as much time with my kids it's not because I don't want to spend time with them many not altogether like usually when I spend time with my children it's separate when I always together unfortunately because my middle son has autism so he takes a little bit more time so I wish that you know we could all be together and I do feel guilty about that
 but it's difficult
 so I try to give them their own individual time
 but it
 hardest decision probably I don't know
 my former occupation my former job relocated for about an hour and a half away something like that little bit over an hour depending upon traffic and was a good paying job great benefits great people but I had to basically
 play myself off from that job which did create a financial hardship in my family but I didn't have a choice because of our you know situation with our son and having only one vehicle for transportation if it's a lot of other factors you know I basically had to stop working and that was a big decision but you know I always say happiness over finances you know you can all I can always you know find another job but you know having my family together and being happy that's a different story
 that's about it
 oh that's easy probably when I had my face injured when I was in the military yeah I wish I could erase that I mean something that I see everyday when I look in the mirror I don't dwell on it it's just there but it is a mark on my face that I didn't deserve
 he knows a traumatic experience but it's been about
 I'm a 15 years or so it's been quite a while but if I could erase it yeah that would be yet
 yes I was in the Navy
 for 4 years
 19
 didn't have any other options it really wasn't
 planning on joining the military but I didn't want to go back to school at the time I just figured you're going to the military with give me the background that I needed and money for school so that's about that shows
 yeah
 I mean can change it I mean I'm not unhappy I'm at a lot of nice people you know so that was good but there was some issues that I had the military that I had not went you know probably would you know when a lot differently but you know you can't change the past
 no glad I did it I'm not really for that uptight person
 yeah it's unfortunate you know but now I did it
 the transition where was it was a little difficult at first you know having to adjust having a fine at the all career and you just
 not having that
 how do you say
 I guess I felt like comfort in the military because I knew that I was always going to have that pay check it out when I was supposed to do I always have a roof over my head you know things like that you know the civilian life basically
 it's your meds you don't know like you lose your job Monday or you know whatever so that's alright transition I got used to it pretty quickly
 thank you
 I went to school I started working with a Communications company
 I did some medical care as well
 got married and have children
 maybe a little bit more responsible I know that for a fact you know if people my age at the time you know didn't have a lot of responsibility most of my still living at home you know at early age I was out on my own no pay my own bills things like that so it did get a little bit more responsibility
 I'm feeling okay
 I already have any complaints
 I mean I feel fine I don't have any complaints about my life you know it is what it is to take it one day at a time that's about it
 yeah probably nothing really to speak about
 cheetah and thought
 yeah
 nothing dramatic
 whenever you go to sleep I usually go right to sleep well. As soon as my head hits the pillow but you know I don't I don't talk to her or anything like that
 very cranky
 very cranky Laura boy I guess
 no not at all
 no not at all
 I feel like I'm always happy I don't know if people tell me that all the time and say I'm always smiling and things like that so probably just morning when I woke up
 thank you
 my mother as much as we argue you know she's such a strong person and you know she's really been there for me and my kids and I just love when she isn't the person you know how she's always doing things for people to see
 you know just a good person
 she means well
 but she's very opinionated
 probably
 Billy Anna how is he is driving
 he probably say I'm typing to look gullible
 I don't think that's what she would probably say
 I don't know could be
 I want our family vacation we actually drove which was different we usually fly so it was a new experience you know going on the road with the kitties
 thank you
 wow that's a tough question
 oh I didn't really
 oh you're welcome
 bye
 I press the button
 that last question I didn't really answer it but she said thanks got it so I left it at that
 I don't know what thank you for
 should I get an answer
 okay sorry
 oldest recorded is Ian sorry
 they're going to think I'm bored
