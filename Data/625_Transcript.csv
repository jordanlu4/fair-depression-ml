regular and so the virtual human to ask you some questions and then
 then Italy speech speech recognition to like I register what you say and then he's a series of
 I know what to do back in the reason that the connection webcam is so that it can also take into account your facial expressions and your posture
 what is war of the sea
 is it a party at college thesis or anything
 bring up the virtual human for a second and then shrink
 I kind of wish that was really cool I am not doing so yet because I have just finished my second year so
 so I don't know yet
 what is the first California visit
 dislike so right
 okay
 oh okay
 I'm going to start the recording okay
 virtual check
 and then
 and then she said she said
 you got it
 okay
 yes
 okay
 I'm feeling pretty good
 where are you from originally Montgomery Alabama
 a lot of the sites of amusement parks lot of different places to go with my children
 it's a big city a lot of stars live here so really it's a cool place
 no not not anymore I used to but no not not lately in the last few years now
 working on a movie set and getting to meet one of my favorite actors and also when I was in the military having being able to travel in Europe in a lot of places I thought I'd never be able to see
 my major was business administration minor was history
 I Need You Now
 actually right now I work part-time I don't have to actually have a steady job but you know I do some work with family members on Home Improvements but the primarily I'm I'm disabled so I don't get a chance to go to work very often at regular job
 what's your dream job
 oh probably work in some type of entertainment film music that's probably been my dream for years and years and I've kind of dabbled in a little bit but never really made
 foothold in that industry
 I say outgoing
 I just love people always have been a people person like to talk to people probably don't talk to people as much as I used to since it ain't got this missing tooth in my in my smile so it kind of takes away from me being as outgoing as I used to be
 relationship with your family
 it's pretty good I have three children have to Mom baby moms meaning you know I have two mothers of my kids but primarily my mom and I are pretty close but I have a very large family but we really don't interact that much
 when I'm feeling then I turn on the fish tank screensaver
 play videogames right read I wish I could get enough get-up-and-go to write a screenplay I've always been wanting to write and you never know what may happen with that but you know if I ever get some get up and go I'll write something but that's primarily what I do
 pretty good I haven't done anything crazy or nothing in my life I guess but I do have a tendency to have a little bad temper
 when was the law
 this was recently argue with a friend over something very silly it was a sports question of something about sports and you know over the years my family are some people in my family have told me there's three things you really don't discuss with people that's politics Sports and religion so I try to stay away from those subjects
 that's a great question I worked for a restaurant downtown who was which was owned by a very affluent lawyer in Los Angeles
 the only reason I'm mentioning his name because he's very prominent lawyer and not only in California but this what's this country and I lost a job they're getting into an argument with the manager of the restaurant but in actuality the owners is partner we're very very kind and they really liked me a lot and I should have never let that situation get to that
 something you feel guilty about
 I think
 probably not spending more time with my children or actually spending time with my oldest daughter who lives in Maryland I feel guilty for not having been more of a success in my life
 not having as much drive and determination as I should have that's probably my biggest no regret or what I feel is guilty about
 tell me about
 probably the hardest decision I've ever had to make was to join the military I had heard a lot of bad things about it at her good things about it but at that particular time of my life I had a you know a fork in the road and I had to choose where they go left to right and I chose to go left and joined the army and turned out it wasn't that bad of a decision
 tell me about midnight or something that
 haven't been a rat being arrested years and years ago
 that's 20 years to be exact and it hasn't really affected me employment wise or anything like that but it's but it's it was on my record and it was something that should have been avoided but it happened and I just wish I could take that one back
 yes
 20 or 21 years old
 well three reasons one I needed a change in my life to I had some personal things going on I felt it was time to like you know just taking advantage of her and try something different and I just wasn't really happy in my college experience so I thought I'd try it
 are you happy
 yes
 no but I can't close
 I worked I was in the military when the Russians were still prevalent in Eastern Europe and we did some board of Duty between the East and West Germany and there are few incidences On the Border that could have gotten out of hand but never did
 fairly easy
 since since leaving the military in 1990 I found myself not being able to kind of interact with people as much as I used to you know things being that I was in the military you think that was a would be a little easier having live with people so close to you all the time but it actually made me a little bit more anxious and have little more anxiety around people
 I came back to Los Angeles and decided to move to Georgia and spent four years in Georgia working and going to school a little bit and then came back to Los Angeles four years later after 1990
 on the positive side I was physically fit when I got out very physically fit and enjoy being that way for several years until you know of some things happened in my life to where I kind of let myself go
 but it changed me and made me more
 orderly place things in perspective
 emotionally pretty good physically tired
 I didn't notice any change.
 If anything I would say
 just started wanting to have more and do more in my life that's about it
 fairly easy I usually
 go to sleep and sleep well some nights I toss and turn but it's rare and I would say it's rare but you know once I get to sleep I sleep fairly well
 hello are visible in the mornings but since I live alone and a lot of people don't really feel that so
 but that ain't none of my kids are around it's it's always more enjoyable to wake up cuz you know I can see their faces and and enjoy their company
 yes
 no I haven't actually been diagnosed with depression but I have bats of that every now and then
 fairly recently I have my kids over for the weekend and I we had a good time enjoying each other's company so I was pretty happy man
 I would probably say Pastor from my church her name is Pastor Beverly Allan she's been kind of a mentor for me for several years and she's a bit of a really big influence in my life and always kind of been there for me
 tell your best friend
 hopefully well they would say I was funny you know reliable steady and you know primarily upbeat person
 I like to bowl so when we go bowling
 play begin a bunch of guys will go out we'll go bowling just have a good evening and you know enjoying each other's company and trying to kick each other's butt on the Bowling
 my children
 they're my pride and joy then extension of me once I pass away the bill live on I live on through them so it's just an honor to know your have three healthy children that are happy very intelligent and maybe make a good Market Society
 thank you
 goodbye
