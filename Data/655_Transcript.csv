 okie dokie
 hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in
 and please
 are you okay with this yes
 I'm fine thank you
 where are you from originally Detroit Michigan
 the weather
 the scenery
 my family
 the crime the fast-paced anise
 I don't really feel secure out here
 what's on your mind
 giving birth to my two sons
 child development
 I'm a librarian at a elementary school part-time
 to own my own educational facility
 you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
 outgoing
 I have two sons
 what do you do
 listen to music
 take hot bath with Candlelight
 how are you
 prior to this month I was pretty good
 when was the last time
 maybe a week ago I was on the bus and somebody invaded my private space
 tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle
 the question
 I wish that I would have handled being raped in the military differently
 what's something you feel guilty about
 I can't think of anything
 tell me about the hardest decision I've ever had to
 getting a restraining order against my children's father when I was trying to exit the relationship and he didn't want me to leave
 tell me about Nevada or something that you were
 my entire military experience
 have you ever served
 yes
 17
 my mother threatened me that once I graduated high school that I had to do something and I didn't want to go to college and so I knew from the 10th grade on that I wanted to be in the Air Force
 are you happy you did that
 no not now
 did you ever see
 no
 it was easy
 I got pregnant I ended up going to college anyway
 how did serving in the military change you
 gave me a discipline that I wouldn't have gotten otherwise but it damage me tremendously
 mood swings depressed anxious fearful
 all of the above
 yes
 tell me more about that
 I had basically buried my memory of the military for 30 years now and I only recently started acknowledging that I'm a bit since my youngest son my 21 year-old join the Army in April and as a result of doing that
 my memories have slowly but surely started coming back to
 Guess that my rape in the military and then how I interned got discharged because I was reporting it
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 not very easy at all
 irritable cranky a journalist and the bed the next day not sleeping but just too tired to get up
 have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD
 have you been diagnosed with
 yes
 how long ago were
 3rd of July of this year
 crying uncontrollably not sleeping well
 no will to get up no motivation
 crying at the drop of a hat
 loss of appetite
 Lawson weight
 I need to buy something
 nothing in general just it's just been coming down on me
 tell me more about the
 I don't understand the question
 how do you cook
 I was recently prescribed some medication that I've been taking for a week now I still have emotional outbursts disappointments just take me over the edge things that I can't control
 it bothers me
 when the memories first started
 yes I do
 all right
 you feel therapy and beautiful yes I do
 can you tell me about that
 I'm in group therapy at the veterans hospital and
 being in a group situation it just lets me see that the things that I'm going through in the things that I'm feeling or not just me I'm not crazy
 I'm able to talk about
 the rape in the military and how I eventually got put out and now I'm having to fight for my benefits because I serve less than 2 years so it kind of feels like the fight is continuing
 good question
 can you tell me about that
 it was probably January 1st of this year it was my granddaughter's 4th birthday
 both my sons my granddaughter my daughter-in-law
 in my 88 year old grandmother who still lives in Detroit
 how would your best friend describe you
 aloof a loner I don't hang out I don't communicate with him as much
 I took my granddaughter to the Natural History Museum
 what are you most proud of in your
 the fact that I'm good at my job and I am a loving mother and grandmother
 thanks for sharing your thoughts with me you're welcome
 goodbye
 I didn't need the tissue after all
