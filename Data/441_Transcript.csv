yes
I'm doing fine thank you
 Los Angeles California
 the variety of people
 the Multicultural food
 and
 going to movie
 real people scary people
 violent
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer
 you travel a lot yes
 experiencing different things in different cultures
 well I was stationed in Germany for three years it was a great experience
 food was great averion Alps the snow the people I loved it
 having a baby
 well it was this the most memorable thing in my life something I never forget
 great
 once I'm grown handsome father-of-two
 no it's actually very hard for me
 not becoming angry too quickly
 being able to cultivate a mind and love someone unconditionally
" well I went through a lot of trauma as a child so as a parent I was very afraid for my child to go to that thing
 I think it's really hard because you never really know people and what they'll do
 outgoing
 because if I'm in a room with people I'm usually
 the first one to start talking
 doesn't matter fact I have fish aquarium that's what keeps me calm
 not very good
 seems like everyday argue with somebody about something but yesterday
 I'm a lady tried to cut line in the grocery store and I politely told her I was in line and she didn't want to move
 yes it have because sometimes if people don't want to move then I feel it's my place to move them
 hurting people physically
 if I feel disrespected or somebody puts their hands on me I can get very ugly I don't like that about
 I was pulled over by the police and they had someone with my name and they were very rude to me and I really wasn't happy with the way they treated me
 how to stay calm when someone has
 crossed over into my boundary
 my personal space
 I can't let people get too close to me if they do I eyelash out I don't want anybody in my area of
 protection I guess
 stay away from people
 stay away from him it's hard you can't live in this world without other people sometimes I just irritate the heck out of me
 being assaulted in the military something I wish I could forget
 just that I felt helpless alone ashamed and angry
 that's about all I want to go into it
 18
 very young
 no
 because I was assaulted in and I have a fear of
 people in uniform like policemen hurting me or other military veterans hurting me when they
 explode or go off or have issues of
 PTSD
 I can't remember
 what did you do after the military
 I work for the federal government
 well just seemed like a normal progression the federal government gives you 10 point preference over other people for being in the military still being like a Natural Choice organization that had a book of rules and they follow them the government what government to another
 are you happy
 yes
 well it was hard in the sense that in the military you're giving you told to handle it handle it and in the civilian world you have to go through so many hoops and different people to talk to to get something done
 administration of justice
 no I'm I don't work anymore
 oh yeah
 almost 2 years
 the feeling that I was always going to be hurt that someone was out to get me I had nightmares panic attacks anxiety attacks out
 outbursts of anger
 I was always an emotional pain
 and I always wanted to hit somebody
 yes mostly disrespect what I feel is disrespect of people getting too close to me or I feel in fear of them for some reason
 I can't remember the last time I had a good night sleep
 what
 irritable angry Moody pissed off
 irrational
 tired
 sick of the world angry at the world
 wanting to be left alone
 sometimes I don't want to go on
 yes
 oh yeah oh yeah
 well I I could recognize the trigger now when something is going to trigger me I can at least
 no and act accordingly if I want to
 when I found my grandchildren when they came to visit
 I just so innocent and sweet and precious it was just a joy to have them around 8 make me forget about all the pain in life
 planting seeds for some vegetables making a garden
 I read somewhere that it's calming and soothing to work with your hands and dirt so I decided to find out
 plant something and watch it grow
 sitting on the beach look facing the water
 thinking talking to God
 wishing I was somewhere else
 Kauai
 Penthouse / Maui
 that I could trust people
 that I wouldn't lash out at them
 I could sleep at night
 crazy
 hot headed
 emotional
 being in the wrong place at the wrong time
 don't trust anyone be careful be wary of people and what they want from you
 I said I grandchildren
 I don't have a real family I don't I haven't seen my brothers in like 20-30 years I only have two brothers and I don't haven't seen them my mother's family I haven't seen in years my father's family haven't seen in years my parents are dead and my son lives in another state
 wow
 some of the older people that I give care to
 sometimes I'm a caregiver so sometimes the people that I work with older and wiser
 I'm loyal
 spiritual
 supportive kind generous
