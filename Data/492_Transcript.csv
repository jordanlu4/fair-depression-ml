get out my ass shadow
 okay
 hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today
 yes
 I'm pretty good at drinking
 Maryland
 yes
 85
 yeah yeah it is long time
 I don't know I'm not as often as I like
 out of work so you know the money issue
 yeah
 Maryland is different it in so the comparison is
 the only comparison is that they're both cities but Maryland has its flavor in La has its own flavor so they have unique you know characteristics about themselves
 I moved to LA because I was living in Hawaii and I was out of money and I just got enough for plane ticket I'm coming stay here in a hotel until I found a job which I did really quickly anyway so that's why I came here I didn't want to go home I decided to come here and just start over
 I am I am
 it was really easy just did it
 I like I like Ellie's whether I like the different areas in Los Angeles County West LA East LA I like Southern California you know. So you know like the people but yes I like them the
 attitude you know the LA attitude so yeah
 I don't like I don't like some of the policies with regard to the smoking you know I really wish that the government would crack down on smoking on the streets make it like USC yeah
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a
 no not outside of but getting on the bus and things like that
 I was studying to be a nurse
 yeah
 I wanted to have a job that pays well but afforded me the opportunity to use my service gift so yeah
 no I had to put that put that on the side and I want to get a business degree now
 yeah my dream job is
 is 2
 create new technology
 can you tell me about that
 other than to say I would like to create something that will change the world like Steve Jobs with his iPhone
 yeah
 I am it depends on the situation but I'm more outgoing
 I do tend toward the little shyness from time to time
 what I do is I'll go to the movies
 I went to the movies probably like maybe 5 weeks ago
 yeah
 well I had an argument recently not really argument but a disagreement with a woman at my church who is over this particular Department that I'm in and it's a volunteer position I use my Administrative Assistant more executive assistant skills to to I do minutes for meetings that I cover and until then I have to produce the minutes and send them to everybody and things like that and this person is micromanaging me but not micromanaging the other admin assistant who did not get her block of people into this particular meeting so the meeting should have been comprised of a hundred people but we have like maybe 30 even 3020
 yes so now she doesn't know that I realize you know that part of it so there was a little bit of a argument and but again not a argument but a disagreement and when we talk again I will point out to the person that's over both of us that there is a disconnect and the energies she's investing in me is unprofitable for what we're trying to achieve
 that does not sound good
 well a little attacked
 you know so
 it depends on I'm very good at controlling my temper it's you know there are places where you can allow your temper to come out even though it might not be appropriate and then there are other places where if it comes out then you shot yourself in the foot so I'm pretty good at controlling my temper
 yeah
 I don't have any situation recent that I can think of
 probably say just dealing with a neighbor instead of responding to the neighbor just ignore the neighbor all together so I wish I'd done that differently
 yeah
 thankfully
 I've not had to make that type of decision in my life as yet
 I have what I do in my life and then and you know in my
 going forward you know everything that I've done and everything that has happened I
 accept it as something that has to be to get me to go for it I am a born again Christian and so I know that that God is Sovereign over my life and also that according to his word the Bible says that everyday of our life is written in his book so events and circumstances I feel that I feel they are ordained by God not obviously I'm not going to jump into a burning fire or do anything ridiculous but
 I feel that things that have that have happened even if I've dealt with them the wrong way it's God's his total sovereignty has control over that and it will work for my good so that's how I feel
 I have all brothers and so I'm not really that close with my brothers
 and my mother
 say that again
 people that have grown up with neighbors from when I when I was younger that I was close to different friends that I've had along the way friends who are more like family so yeah
 they've had positive influence
 that's I get I sleep too well
 so I sleep well every night
 normal but I my normal I've been feeling my normal
 no
 no
 no
 that was really something happened
 I was able to participate
 with my church on Sunday with I was a Pentecost it was Pentecost Sunday meeting it was 50 days after the resurrection of Jesus Christ and so I was able to participate in a prayer session that we had at my church and I thought that was really made me very happy
 that I'm smart they would say that I'm smart that
 that I handle difficulties very well
 and then I dress well
 I don't want to change anything I do want to just be a better me so be a better person so I am working on listening better communicating better and and accepting my
 weaknesses better as well as my strengths
 no
 that's a good question I would have I would have told myself to
 to do what I know to do to do what I know that which is right and
 I can do what I know is right and let everything else let the other chips fall where they may but to do what I know to do is right and they go forward
 I am very proud of the fact that I don't give up
 bye and thank you see you all
 thank you
 I'm deaf
