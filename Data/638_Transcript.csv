when she sounds you should say
but definition
 and if not when she's done
 yes
 I'm feeling okay
 I'm from Inglewood California
 the weather
 the shopping the museums
 traffic
 cost of living
 now
 my 21st birthday
 I went to Walt Disney World for my 21st birthday
 interior design
 I do nothing
 what's your dream job
 interior designer
 more shy
 tell me about
 I get along well with my father I don't get along so great with my brother
 sometime
 I know it's not
 I read a book
 I'm very good at controlling my temper
 I argued maybe two weeks ago with my father because he didn't put the dishwashers the dishes correctly in the dishwasher
 I wish I would have done much better in college
 I feel guilty about spending my money on stupid things
 tell me about the hardest decision
 pulling the plug on my mother
 okay
 I wish I could erase my final year in college when my mother passed away
 have you ever
 now
 I've been feeling a bit down in the dumps
 yes I'm a little bit more upbeat
 I recently got involved in a book club
 it's not very easy
 grumpy
 now
 no
 when is the
 last Saturday
 I went to a ladies luncheon and I enjoyed myself
 I don't have many positive influences in my life
 can you tell me about that
 my home is filled with a lot of negative energy and I don't have any friends to rely on
 how would your best friend describe
 I don't have a best friend
 I went to the movies and saw Monsters University
 being the first person in my family to graduate from college
 goodbye
 hey
