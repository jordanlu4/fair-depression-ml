 I know it's been awhile
 maybe not working hard enough some days
 when your freelancer it's hard to keep at yourself to consistently be productive

 I probably
 once when I moved back to Los Angeles from Boston
 and
 I had a girlfriend at the time and

 I drove up beside her and I said in a pleasant way I said I was just trying to signal to get into your lane and she was cursing at me through the window prior to that and she looked it up or just looked it up for finger gave me the finger and it was just
 it's funny sometimes you try to approach someone in just a normal loving way and all they have for you is hate and that did make me feel bad
