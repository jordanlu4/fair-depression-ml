 I'm just the adventure of a going to new places and just getting away from Los Angeles and time
 I'd like to hear about one of your trips
 have you been a recent one by one in the path of just last one was to San Francisco who had the opportunity to drive up the Pacific coast and to just take my time and drive up the coast enjoy the views and just enjoy the stops along the way the food and the people

 the recap and catch up on things

 a very strong relationship with my family or my mom passed away a couple years back so we're extra extra clothes clothes with all my brothers and sisters Dance With My Father for very close family and I miss him right now they're all back East but you know we're pretty close
 pretty much are you
 I read a lot of reading meditating sometimes praying but basically reading
 how are you
 remember you're controlling my temper
 really can't remember I haven't argued with anyone in such a long time it's just not
 prudent thing to do is only going to cause you stress so I don't I don't think that a part of my daily ritual I can't even remember the last time I argue with someone
 tell me about a situation that you wish you would have
 I'm not sure right now in that one
 I don't feel guilty about anything
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
 I see you
 probably moving moving away from east coast to West Coast being away from my family
 tell me about news
 there's nothing that I wish to erase for my memory everything that's there is there for a reason and I accept it that way and so there's that's just how I see it so it's just a part of your life part of the journey that you taken there's no reason for me to try to erase anything that already happened just as a part of me it makes me the person I am

 are you happy
 very heavy
 I know I didn't
 I'm not really easy to be a little
 getting used to again you know it's something you miss for a while for yesterday 3 or treat yourself to that type of life again but it wasn't and it wasn't as easy but it was doable
 what did you do after the military
 I went back to school
 okay
 how did serving in the military change you
 I might be more disciplined any more appreciation for my country and then maybe put things into priority right to life in the life events in how I do things HealthEast see things open up my eyes to bigger world and could help me in those respects
