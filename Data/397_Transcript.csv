 my mother
 my kids my grandkids
 I'm one of them one of the three three sons really didn't have any experience with the females other than with my mother in terms of being the unrelated and my grandma and my first daughter was born I was like why was it so I'm madly in love with her
 change my life
 that's what happened
 when my mother got sick I wish I wasn't there for her the way she should have been
 but I don't feel good
 oh yeah you can always fix what you do with you
 I was just in a real bad situation
 but that doesn't excuse the fact that I wasn't there the way I should have been
 at least I Did It My Way
 why my second marriage probably she she wanted to have children already had my children with my first wife and I had told her initially that I did not want to have children that you know I'm going to head 3 and I was good with that and she indicated that she did not want to have children
 so we got married and then her best friend guy pregnant and our relationship changed and
 I basically wouldn't relent and we had to get a divorce
 I don't know what I would have had to it would have would have had children with her but I
 I wasn't very flexible in the process
 what to be flexible
 sometimes I am sometimes or no
 I've been pulled my boy my father out of off of life support
 what made you decide to do that I just keep going back to something he said to me when I was younger that he would come back and haunt me and if I do know if I let him Lay It lay there and suffer
 took me a while to convince my other two brothers but that's what we do
 can I get erased from my memory
 being locked up for a while like erase it from my memory
 it's an everyday hell where there's very little Humanity
 and you got to do some things that you're not proud of
 how easy is it
 I've never slept I'm never slept a lot and I'm one of those people that if I wake up I have a hard time going back to sleep so it's best if I'm really tired than you know
 what are you
 I'm pretty much so with the same oil change
 socialite
 things are good with the kids and the grandkids except for the live incident with my granddaughter Midol youngest daughter but I had a friend recently who was runned over in a crosswalk and then he's on he's on life support Simon feeling too good about that it's it's affected me
 was like he was jaywalking and he literally was walking in the crosswalk and the guy never even hit the brakes o
 and he's on that life support at this point
 have you noticed any changes in your behavior or soccer
 no not really because that's the thing about me is I'm very inconsistent
 no
 no
 but I've had moments when I thought I was I was depressed okay I was talk to you when you were talking to any other question
 yesterday
 had a conversation with my 14 year old granddaughter
 I'm happy I have moments of Happiness everyday cuz I either speak to text with my daughters and granddaughters everything even if we're upset with one another
 I have a lot of regrets
 can you give me an
 I should have went to law school
 that's that's kind of something I thought you were going to think about more in my lifetime it was accepted I just didn't I had other other things I thought I wanted to do
 I played with those wanting to be a kicker for football on the football team and had some tryouts things like that but didn't pan out
 and that is as that didn't pan out I sort of lost my zest for wanting to be a lawyer
 we just did other things
 I'll take a big that was different I probably would listen to myself
 by myself
 I could be
 if I don't like you I can be very very difficult if I don't like you
 I'd very much like to change that
 it has in the past year
 well I just threw that you can make me feel bad about myself only if I let you and I'm not real big on letting people do that to me on my first wife when when she left me with the children she you know that it was my fault
 and I wasn't sure that I believe that but I knew I was an ass and and so I probably believed it and not in its totality but in part
 I'm very I'm not judgemental I will listen to anybody but that I agree with you or disagree with you
 I've taught myself to
 control anger that I that I have
 and if if I call you my friend or if I tell you I love you and I mean it that's that's not something that I do
 casually
 okay why I play 18 holes of golf with it with an old dear friend we got caught up and
 4 hours on the golf course 2 hours at dinner
 that is your wife have a good time
 a lot a lot of memories came in
 why am I not like my grandkids I like that you know I like the hell out of them
 I don't have all kids in like that I think they're like too much on that rely too much on technology but
 but that's me mainly cuz I don't
 but if my grandkids are any any sampling of it I think they're good think they're pretty good
 I raised my girls
 basically by myself with the help of my mother
 I think that's the thing I'm most proud of
 okay nice chatting with you
