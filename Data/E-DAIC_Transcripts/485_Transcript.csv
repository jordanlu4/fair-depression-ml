I may have you
 all right
 okay sure
 yes
 I'm not bad I'm a little tired but okay
 I from st. Louis Missouri
 yep
 2 months ago
 not often I think I'm out here for good now
 smaller town less people Everyone kind of acts different the pace of life is slower out there
 looking for work as a game designer and developer just try something new to new place new people
 I guess I'm still getting used to it
 I guess people are different you know there's little shops everywhere just everything's different
 the weather is great out here
 people are really nice
 like to look at the mountains the beaches nice just better geography
 traffic I guess the commute and sometimes there's maybe too many people
 not really never been outside of the us before
 I just never had the opportunity I'd love to go though
 a game design and graphic design sort of
 I love it
 play video games since I was a kid like most guys my age so just like making people happy and it's kind of easy to do that with games
 I work for myself make my own games write my own paychecks I guess
 a pretty hard I've been trying to do it for the past couple years it's a little difficult
 I guess I'm kind of shy it depends on the people in the environment I guess
 play guitar listen to some music talk to friends
 play I'm pretty good at controlling my temper I'm not the type of guy that gets angry really easily
 probably with my girlfriend over something silly I can't even remember
 don't know I don't think I'm really guilty about anyting try to avoid being guilty
 don't know
 can't really think of anything
 leaving St Louis was one of them is all my friends and family were there
 I guess the benefits outweighed you know the cons
 are you happy
 definitely
 Maybe getting kicked out of high school first time
 I just I ended up getting myself and then my friends in trouble and it was just no good you kind of look back on it and
 I guess that's something for my pastor wish I would have done different
 follow the rules I guess just been a good student would have helped
 not really that close with my family I've got a small family anyway and when I was in St Louis we'd see each other a couple times a year but that's really it so no strong ties
 I guess most of my friends are always there to support me and encouraged me and helped me so
 it's a pretty easy every once in a while there's a night I can't sleep but it's pretty rare
 just tired groggy guess my mind's unfocused and day goes by a heck of a lot longer
 I'm pretty good
 not really much to say
 maybe a little bit more depressed cuz I'm away from most of my friends and family but nothing unmanageable
 try to talk to him when I can think about something else think about a happy times
 no
 no
 I guess on the drive out here so it was such a new experience and so exhilarating
 I think graduating college those really proud of myself and really looking forward to the future
 just I guess kind of euphoria standing there it seems kind of surreal
 funny caring nice guy
 easily along with
 pretty happy being me I guess
 guess what I broke up with my last girlfriend for obvious reasons we tend to fight and say things you wish you'd forget I guess
 now I don't like to live in the past so there's nothing to really regret
 keep working hard and just keep thinking about what you do before you do it
 on the computer playing video games with friends
 music
 and my friends I guess
 I guess my determination of might have my passion
 my creativity
 all right
