 at peace
 calm
 depends on the situation
 I argued with
 the Los Angeles parking people over a ticket that I got that I didn't agree with and is morphed into a horrible situation and I
 ended the conversation with accepting the situation as it was and not really wanting to deal with it sort of like fuck you
 it was good
 oh my gosh the sale of my business I wish I would have handled that differently I didn't have to really sell the business but I got scared and I sold it and I could have handled it in a much different way
 fear
 can you tell me about that
 I was afraid of mounting debts I was afraid of
 the economy wasn't good this 2007/2008 I was not thinking clearly I was afraid of mounting debts I was afraid of being sued by employees I was afraid of
 yeah not having enough money I was afraid to be embarrassed I was
 embarrassed you know for running out of money
 yeah I would have handled that much different knowing what I know today
 it was
 yes I could have I could have downsized I could have
 downsized sold cars got rid of cars I
 could have cut hours I could have reduced my expenses and sat tight with it and not and just worked through it to not have reacted out of fear

 because she
 she ripped off the Family Estate my grandson my grandparents estate she she took all the money and all the stuff and and left her grandkids and her and Mike you know and so her sister and my my grandmother's daughter and grandkids and great-grandkids got zero
 and it was a few few few million dollars so we don't talk
 I don't talk we don't talk
 and it's sad
 excuse me can you repeat that
 wowed house if my father was a positive influence he was a really genuine man honest funny handsome I have a business owner a businessman that I work for who was it extremely positive influence at least in my professional life I've had a counselor at UCLA who was totally I think of her
 often and some of the little things that she said to me keep me going in my life now
 trust the process
 she told me to trust the process and when people are having trouble and I'm having trouble I take it step back and say you know just trust the process it it it all works out the way it's supposed to be
 I'm just one more positive influence that I knew in Hawaii that taught me
 a friend of mine that lives on Kawaii that taught me
 how to enjoy nature and taught me how to fish and and I love her a lot too great positive influence healthy healthy influence
 it's not
 I have back problems so it's hard to sleep at night and I wake up in the middle of the night sort of
 stretching and straightening out my back I have a back issue that sometimes more often than not
 keeps me from sleeping good
 that's okay I'm dealing with it
 I'm a little depressed I've been a little depressed I haven't been working as much and
 I you know I have pain in the mornings and in the evening I have pain throughout the day and night with my back and it's just a little depressing you know I get depressed all so you know just thinking about my business that I sold and you know where I would have been if I hadn't of done that and
 a general feeling of
 I've been a little depressed over the past couple of years actually
 yes
 well I've been diagnosed many many years ago and I guess depression stays with you although it gets treated and I was diagnosed about two years ago I think I don't know what to ask me that on the questionnaire as well and I sought treatment for it and then my insurance ran out and the prescriptions I couldn't put the do my prescriptions anymore but now I'm back on medication and so I take medication for my depression
 therapy absolutely
 I love therapy
 wow that's huge confidence and self
 confidence in myself confidence in my decision-making a general feeling of
 overall content a sounding board you know when I have stuff that's bothering me that I can't go to the I feel that I can't go to the person with I can go to my therapist in
 a lot of times the issue is resolved there it wasn't a big issue or I work through it or the therapist through the therapist allowed me to look at a different way of looking at the situation and in that way I find therapy to be invaluable actually
 I believe so yes I was
 I believe it was and he was told to me by a psychiatrist that that's what I was that's what I was having and this was within the last five years I think it was
 looking back now
 what are we 2013 it was 2009 so 4 years ago
 I'm not able to deal with like Shell Shocked not able to deal with anything irritable on the phone I mean just just anything would get me to fly off the handle and I'm just not able just shell-shocked and not hiding it my in my house not opening mail not being able to concentrate not being able to deal with
 with things that were that I felt were will that were bombarding me I felt overcome and the psychiatrist said that it was supposed to matter stress disorder butts and I was given some medication which I stayed on for a year or so or so and I don't know through Psychiatry and therapist and medication I was able to come out of my shell a little bit
 about a week ago I was on a hike and up in Malibu and at this beautiful Labrinth that looked over the Pacific Ocean and I was with a friend and we were having lunch
 and I lay down in the grass and took a nap and I felt content I was happy at that moment at that moment that time a week ago
 honest sincere
 smart
 caring
 smart
 good question
 I'd have to think about that
 yeah I have regrets in life and everything works out so you know if I could change the past I would have never dropped out of school when I did a long time ago I mean I've since gone back and completed lots of stuff I probably would have gone into the military I think I was going to do that in my early twenties I'm 55 now I sort of regret not doing that at that time
 I regret
 selling my business
 I regret
 of course I can't control this but I regret that my father died when I was so young and
 he never really got to know me and I never really got to know him
 I regret
 I regret not seeing
 my grandmother enough before she passed away
 I regret
 I mean those are the things that I can think of right now not putting away for retirement I regret when I had the money to do it
 yeah I mean just here that's what I would say
 stick with it
 just stick with it because in order to get out you have to go through and
 I when it comes to fear or flight I get the fear and I flight so sometimes you just have to sit in fear and then
 everything works out
 wow
 I'm most proud that I have remained
 genuine I'm most proud of
 being who I am and being basically comfortable with that and I'm proud of that I haven't changed
 to the warp to the world you know for the world I haven't changed I've stayed
 who I am
 thank you
 thank you
 bye
