 are you okay with
 yes I am
 oh my mocha
 Chicago
 back and forth over the years and traveled a little bit
 haven't been out there over 15 16 years
 kind of got stuck out here then I have my baby and I just ate
 different food the people get along way I don't get it it's kind of a culture shock
 tell me about
 out there just on the food bases they like to give you a lot of food that tastes real good for a little bit of money to keep a lifelong customer but out here they want to go up there and give you a little bit of food for a whole lot of money so they just make it Mike
 parent have business out here
 not our got to get used to anymore
 the views in the ocean
 just splitting of people that's it
 just a few places
 what do you enjoy
 getting in to see different people on learn how different people get along and interact with each other
 I want to hear about your trip
 I remember years ago where I went to Mexico with my brother
 yeah
 jumping into a lake pretty much off the side of a mountain
 yeah
 everything
 it's not a subject I don't like
 actually my dream job
 working with computers and helping people
 that's
 where my heart is I like computers and also like helping people
 sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver
 I meditate workout
 I'll run I walk
 alright read
 in the median
 I'd say very good
 oh yeah that doesn't make it seem that good last time I argued was over someone actually spitting out a racial slur or it's my wife
 angry
 upset her disrespected
 and especially when I went up there that treat the person actually I was treating them with dignity and respect and trying to help the person the first
 no problem people are people
 how to Chance in school with a really go a lot further than I did
 and I let something very small and meaningless stopped me in the pursuit of it
 ignorance
 for lack of a better word
 now that I think back on it I could have done a whole lot to avoid it but I was just young and foolish
 start loving again
 much pain as I've seen in the world
 tell me about
 a compilation of all the events are just different bad things that I've seen
 if I could change it I would but sometimes
 I guess things are there for a reason even though we may not understand it
 I have no answer to that
 blood family really don't talk
 my wife
 don't know if she really wants to be there with me or not she thinks that I'm doing everything in the world but that I'm not really
 I don't understand I know my daughter loves me but I don't know if she wants to be with me or not
 because
 when somebody talks to you
 when I say something a certain amount of times in the tonnage in a voice and a belief in their eyes
 if you say something so many times it would really lies in your heart so you can say whatever through your mouth but it's what really is there
 I love my daughter
 she's Angel I'll cut her umbilical cord went out there and put on her first shirt
 I seen her come out
 she looked at me right out the stomach she wouldn't she was fighting with the doctors wouldn't let him touch her a bit
 I talked to her I told her to calm down I told her it was daddy she looked up at me grab my fingers and like just calm down and just let him do everything they needed to do
 no it's constantly changing fast what you have to do on this day won't be the same thing as the next or the next after that it's constantly
 what is a better word for
 adjusting
 the hardest thing I'll probably say
 is
 Spalding your child because you know you're doing it out of love for not learning the wrong lessons
 seeing your baby smile and appreciation
 I try to guard my baby a lot more from things that she sees
 when I was younger there were a lot of things I seen that no child or adult should have seen and
 I grew up
 I swore to myself that always take care of my child and I wouldn't disappear
 let her be around things like that
 okay
 my foster parents
 can you tell me about
 they basically showed me no matter where you come from
 you can always strive to get better
 okay
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 a good night sleep
 it comes
 the same just tired of yarn
 have I been feeling
 Ike
 I have a wealth of queries and
 a well that goal
 within my grasp and it's just right out of my route because I just need that one
 connector to really just
 see what I'm capable of and I know I'm capable of a lot it's just
 I need to make that connection
 no
 not PTSD no
 I said yes but I don't figure on many more depressed or anything than any other person everyone has their different breaking points
 okay
 tell me about the last time you felt
 my daughter's birthday on the 26th

 took her out to Chuck-E-Cheese she had fun she play games she was on bikes she was crawling through puzzle games man squad about everything
 find loyal caring
 what are some things you wish you could change about your
 time to change
 I would like to be more accurate
 is there anything you regret
 now getting to know who my mom was
 what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago
 stop thinking about whatever else happened to just do what you need to do
