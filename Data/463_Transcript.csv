okay cool
 hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today
 yes I am
 I am pretty good
 I was born in Los Angeles California
 yes
 I like the fact that everything is closed by all the stores and shops
 the traffic
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot of trouble but not too much
 going away from your usual days exploring new sites
 3 weeks notice a month ago I went to Las Vegas with me and my friends and we just went sightseeing
 in Las Vegas we went to the Hoover Dam and it was breathtaking the it was really big and we saw the Big Canyon and it was impressive I never seen something like that before
 I studied nursing
 I graduated two months ago so I took my board exam to be licensed and I passed so I'm just waiting for my license in the mail
 my dream job is to be a registered nurse
 long time ago when I was a little boy I got injured and my parents had to take me to the hospital and the doctors came by and they had to stitch me up on the leg and I saw all of that and that made me want to pursue the medical field
 are you happy
 yes I am very happy
 my relationship with my family is okay not good not bad it's if it's in between
 I am close I am very close to them if I have a problem or I go to them for help
 someone who's been a positive influence has been my best friend since elementary school
 yes
 yes we've known each other since we were in the third grade and we've we've gone to a lemon tree middle school and high school together and he lives like two blocks away so he's basically like like a brother of mine
 I am shy
 I really don't know I've always been a quiet person ever since I can remember
 what do I do if I
 I going to my room I turn my AC on and I just relax in my bed
 I am pretty good I'm pretty good at controlling my temper yes
 the last time I argued with someone was about
 work
 I was disappointed not angry just disappointed
 because my manager he wanted me to do something faster than what I usually can handle and he already knew that my workload was a lot but he didn't understand that so that made me just very like sad
 I cannot remember one
 the hardest decision I ever had to make was
 dropping out of school
 I felt that I didn't really belong far away from home and so I was just thinking ahead I was in a major that I didn't really like and so
 I decided to just not go next semester and go back home to LA
 are you happy
 right now that I'm looking at it yes I am very happy that I did that because I wouldn't have gone to nursing school and I wouldn't have been a licensed vocational nurse right now
 I don't have an event
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 it depends on the days where I work or where I don't work
 yes right now I I work at at a retail store early in the morning I I go at 3 in the morning and I get out at 10 a.m. so it's really hard for me to get a good night sleep
 when I don't sleep well I can be a little bit grumpy irritated or just frustrated with the situation
 lately I've been okay I'm been good
 no I have not
 okay
 no
 no
 the last time I was really really happy and excited was when I found out that I passed my license board exam to be a nurse
 my best friend would have just would describe me as a caring nice sweet shy quiet guy
 physically speaking I would change how I look from the outside
 I am overweight and I would like to lose some weight and just look good from the outside
 I don't have one
 no I don't
 just one time
 I at my work it's a retail store I kind of took some merchandise without buying it
 what made you decide to do that
 it was a risk that I took but since no one was around and D up the opportunity was right there for me to get it I just got it and I took it home
 I don't know
 yes last weekend I went to I went yard selling with my family and it was pretty fun going out to different yard sales and finding random stuff
 I bought this big black bean bag it was huge and it was on it was only for $2 and so I got it and now it's in my room and I sit on it
 I am most proud of is the fact that I am a nurse that I am a nurse I'm just waiting for my for my license in the mail and after that I would just send out my resumes to different hospitals and call Aunt nursing homes
 I think I got everything I need
 thanks for sharing your thoughts
 bye
