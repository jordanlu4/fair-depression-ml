 and
 I wish I wasn't drinking at the time I could have just waited a couple more days and got back in
 settle the score.
 What's something you feel guilty about
 my daughter my youngest daughter she's having issues with her substance abuse and sometimes I blame myself for that I never was into any kind of drugs or anything like that but sometimes I didn't cuz I am an alcoholic that sometimes I I feel that maybe it was kind of set of my fault but I really I just felt like maybe I could help more
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to
 Nowell
 my when my father was in the hospital we were having a discussion about
 him taking them off life support and not know it was that since I'm the oldest brother
 but my step-brother was the youngest I know he was living with him at the time so it was kind of hard with the the brother is more less handling the situation that was kind of rough
 tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from
 it's on the can end up drunk and stupid or I can my car
 my first marriage I know is cuz of my drinking I wish I'd
 went along with help myself for a guy help
 sooner than I did and I blame myself for my work first marriage not ending in a good way

 how is the weather
 pretty much easy I really didn't have no
 conflict with civilian life at all I work with the National Guard if I didn't have any work on civilian side I was found work with the guard so it made it kind of easy and that's why I enjoy the National Guard so much that was good for me and I hope it was good for them
 I just
 part time work here and there help friends so

 how did serving in the military change you
 mentally tough that's can't me a lot you know have more self-control and
 just be more aware
