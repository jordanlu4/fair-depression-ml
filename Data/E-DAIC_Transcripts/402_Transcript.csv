 Atlanta Georgia
 in 2006
 never
 I don't like it there
 it's completely boring and there's very little to do la is preferable I think to most places
 because I was engaged to my fiance and we lived in Florida I moved there to be with him and he loves the water but I love the mountains I missed hiking and I love Florida and he wasn't tied to it so we decided we wanted to go somewhere where we can both be happy and also have more opportunities in business and
 all of the great things that I have to offer
 very
 easy
 there's not much I don't like about la I love La I think it feels magical so many creative different people of all ages shapes sizes colors races the mountains of water
 the city all the things that there are to do all of the different people there are to meet I just I love everything about la
 no
 I'd rather not talk about it
 I didn't go to college
 I'm still figuring that out
 I don't know it may may have something to do with animals I have a dog that I really loved and I never had a dog as an adult I had cats and
 I think I'm a late bloomer so I'm working on that whole conversation I don't I really don't want a job I want a purposeful way to create wealth not just something to make money in the long run
 it depends on the situation but in general I consider myself more Scheib although most people would consider me to be outgoing
 sometimes when I'm feeling
 I turn on the fish tank screensaver
 what do you do
 put on classical music music classical music especially stressed and play with my dog
 go for a walk
 I think I'm really good at controlling my temper
 for the most part
 before I came here it was just about them
 Financial stress
 there's probably a lot of examples I think I'd rather move to another question
 yeah I'd rather not talk about that either
 I'd rather not talk about that
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 not very easy at all
 I'm a lot better recently but I have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems so it's challenging not to feel rested most of the time
 in the past week I've been feeling a lot better
 tell me about that
 yes I
 the weather has changed spring has sprung it's a little warmer as having more trouble with my depression in the winter and having trouble with tolerating cold and so I wasn't doing a lot of the things that I normally do and I also was sick with the flu and in the past week I decided that I was feeling better enough that I needed to kind of get out of my rut and start getting more focused around things that I need to do during the day and walking my dog everyday and not isolating so much
 sing some of my friends more so I was feeling I've been feeling a lot better like I've been making progress and that
 in the past week things have taken a more positive turn
 no
 yes
 it's been quite some time of officially it's probably been
 I don't know exactly but let's see
 maybe more than 15 years ago
 I was feeling suicidal
 no
 because I found a better alternative
 I've been there be off and on since I was 18 and I'm tried a variety of methods and then I started working with some neuro-linguistic programming her and that was really the first person that helped me
 make permanent changes and I was able to get off my antidepressants as well and even though I struggle with some bouts of depression it's never been anything extremely severe and I was one of the best things that ever happened
 well I was physically ill with chronic fatigue syndrome and I had a client that referred me to this person because he had cured her of that disease and
 that was he treats multiple issues and so everything is interrelated so
 once I had my first conversation with him I knew it was the right step for me
 I'm so happy
 I felt like I was some
 I felt that
 I found the answer that I've been looking for that I hadn't given up hope
 panda
 I would like I'm glad 9 that I had been suffering for a long time and I felt that I finally
 found
 the answer to the
 solution that I was looking for I was like
 every last thing I ever did in my life or the best decision I ever made
 extremely helpful for the first time in a long time
 I went to
 I went to a music store
 because I've been thinking about I'm taking up an instrument I used to play the violin as a child and I've been wanting to do something that would give me more access to my creative side because I felt it's been extremely depressed and numb
 that's how I went to the music store to try out to see what it would feel like to
 to handle and the instrument again and see if I thought that that was something that I would want to pursue
 it was awesome
 yeah I'd rather not talk about that
 well
 that's probably a lot but
 I'm always working on being more optimistic
 it's been challenging it takes time but
 I wish I could hear my own
 internal voice better
 yeah I have regrets sure
 value myself more so that I would make better
 relationship decisions
 my fiance is the most positive
 person in my life my My ultimate supporter
 tell me about
 I think very unique not the
 not at all selfish and the
 probably a little too giving for his butt
 always has my best interest at heart has the highest morals of anyone I know would give somebody the shirt off of his back is a genius and so many ways and
 I'm pretty lucky I think
 that
 I'm not a quitter that despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time I haven't given up on
 taking risks and
