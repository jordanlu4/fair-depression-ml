where are the cameras I see that one
 let's do it
 and please
 I'm good.
 My little tired
 where you from
 born in LA Live Griffin Carson so California
 you know
 I'm sick of losing my interest in California with more and more everyday so I guess the weather
 if the congestion and all the people that people out here kind of rude now
 I'm sure
 you travel a lot
 not lately no
 no money that's a big part of it and that there's no money no time
 what happened
 everything I was went to college for some Human Services did some solartech installation studies than high school just general study
 nothing I'm unemployed so I stayed
 to own and run my own medical marijuana dispensary
 kind of shy
 not much
 it's okay you know I don't talk to him much I see him every now and again you know I don't see my kids too much but now it is what it is
 sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver
 listen to music play some chess just sit back kind of just relax and let my mind wander
 pretty bad at that I'm working on it though
 when was the
 what's today Thursday so Monday Tuesday it was about somebody trying to tell me how I felt
 tell me about
 all right
 damn good one
 losing my job and not getting my daughter her birthday present on the day of supposed to be there
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had
 shit hard to say that I'd rather make leaving my son leaving my son's mother and my son wasn't an easy decision but it was probably for the best because we weren't getting along that much and I wanted to grow up in that type of environment where was always arguing
 so there
 tell me about Nevada
 the shit that happened to me when I was a kid when I'm with my family members I wish I could just forget about all that and have it not happen
 yeah
 have you ever
 yes
 United States Navy
 how old were you when you done
 19 years old
 yeah 19
 because when I got out of high school that wasn't doing anything I wanted my kids to have something to look up to and it was a promise that me and my buddy made to each other we were going to go in the service together but he died so I went just to keep the promise you know that's it
 are you happy
 yes or no
 real yes or no
 no
 kind of difficult it's kind of hard making add adjustment from being able to tell people what to do and have them do it and then come out and you can't get a job and you don't say if you were telling you what to do you know the structure was different so a little difficult
 that's okay you didn't do it
 I started working at a power plant Mill doing some painting and I've had a bunch of different job since then
 so I did a few jobs
 work work work
 be worked at the airport California rather so you know bunch of different things
 made me a harder person I don't have as much compassion and empathy for people
 so you know it kind of shows you how people can really be
 so yeah that's how change me
 okay
 how do you get feeling lately
 anxious little upset from time to time
 different like I'm changing I just don't know how
 will strange little weird feeling
 yeah I don't want to I don't want to kill people like I used to I'm a little bit more open with people I'm quicker to a talk to him and would not so yeah my big my behavior has changed my attitude
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I don't know it's almost impossible
 I'm working off of maybe two maybe three hours of sleep right now
 so yeah It Don't Come Easy
 A little grumpy agitated all the time just so you know all I'm thinking about is I want to get to sleep in my how come I can't sleep what's keeping me from doing it
 so yeah I'm easily agitated
 have you ever
 yep
 yes yes I have depression PTSD anxiety
 beginning of the year like January February sometime this year
 like I said everybody I saw I want to kill or do some kind of bodily harm to him real short fuse I was mad at everything for nothing you know I don't sleep
 I'm always I hate crowds I don't like going into a confined spaces
 so you know strange places I never been before it's a lot of people I don't like going to
 so yeah I don't like people getting too close to me
 you know that's a good read that's a good answer I mean good question I don't know it just crowns and strange people come in and closer to me and everything else I don't know what that might be it. Just
 what it is but I'm always wondering what the next person is going to do when they get that close to me like especially you think in a crowded room where you can't move around as much and you know I'm always watching the whole everything trying to see who's going to do what and when
 usually I try and get away from the crowd you know that's how I cope with them that I usually just trying to get away from the crowd not focus so much on it but it ain't hard specially if you got to be there but yeah I just kind of stay to myself and watch everything moving
 okay
 A friend of mine who I used to serve in the Navy with he told me
 I should go
" I should go and actually check out what's going on with my back but when I got in there I start talking to the first place I went was the mental health ward and told him what was going on with me
 yeah yes I do well my last therapy session was about a week or two ago but I'm getting scheduled to go back
 into therapy
 yeah yeah yeah it's it's slow me down you know I'm not so quick to want to hurt nobody no more I'm not so while still defensive but
 I don't look at it is I want to go and you'll saying
 put do physical harm the young saying certain people just for being around
 three more about what we want to hurt people
 it's a weird feeling I don't know how to describe it it's kind of like describing the taste of milk to somebody it's just anybody I'll be walking in the hallway and a minute I'm looking at them I'm figuring
 what kind of if I had to encounter that person how would I physically disabled them you know do you know the saying don't show come out do I just strike him in the throat poker I don't say break a leg or arm or something you'll just how can I incapacitate this person
 it's a trip I'm telling you the alternative just had a thought all the time with a complete stranger who really doesn't pose a threat to you is true
 so
 I'm a little more tolerant I don't fly off the handle as much as I used to you know stuff that used to piss me off like you don't say little things I don't really get too upset about a may have sent me but
 my reactions of different I don't like I said I don't explode cuz everything I mean the smallest thing with send me mail saying over the top but not so much no more you know it's kind of breathing take it in stride or try to you know
 so yeah it's just it's working it helps
 oh man really happy
 oh my God
 may all that has been some years it's been some years I can't even really put a finger on what I actually felt really happy
 so you know cuz it's always been I might have moments where you don't say everything's cool and it's a good day or whatever but
 I'm still throughout the day there's they'll still Bostwick creep in and you know I'm saying I'm looking at people this that another thing I'm saying this way and nut so yeah it's been awful long time since I was just genuinely really happy
 great
 is it all right if you say so
 who's the real life
 somebody's been a positive influence in my life my parents you although we have a problems you know I look up to them they've been through with each other for umpteen years and a positive influence to me I mean outside of that there's a old girlfriend of mine named it don't matter who what name is old girlfriend of mine she's
 kind of show me how to take life as it comes and you'll not everything's a battle because she's going through stuff that I'll never have to go through you know saying she's terminally ill but yet she still has a smile on her face and you know just keeps it going so I got to take a
 a page out of her book with that one you know everything's not always all bet
 how would you describe me that's a good question I really cool you know funny
 you know but real honest you know and loyal you know crazy are crazy cool loyal fun and you know just
 all around pretty decent person because he told me that not too long ago you like doing ain't nothing wrong with you man you all right you know you just you human so don't trip
 but yeah that's my boy
 but I really enjoyed
 damn what was it cuz we just did it not too long ago
 you know we
 had a little cookout for some kids at The Villages where we stay at and I did the cooking for him you know it was for us but I got to cook for them and you know they was happy and we got to work in the garden a couple of days after that or the week after that is something so I kind of duck that real cool Yule saying watching a little kids run around happy you insane still innocent not knowing what life is really about the old saying Thanking us for
 the shit we went through so hopefully they don't have to go through it but I had a ball with that a lot of kids
 what are you most proud of
 my children my kids mother my son my daughter's I'm proud of them
 because they're
 did not like me my children are smart there like outstandingly smart you know
 I started out that way but then I got
 into wanting to be a cool kid in school start drinking and running around skipping school and all that but now my kids they don't do none of that and I'm so grateful and proud that you don't think they actually make it somewhere in life my daughters have shipped my daughter in the Africa and other places places I was in the service and then go to she went because she was in school you know my son he's a he's a good kid you don't need a lot more like me than he actually knows he is but he's doing
 so many things that I want to do when I was a kid but I couldn't playing football is playing sports he's going here he's going there you know he's a smart kid he's real smart kid I couldn't be prouder
