 Hoag traveling cross-country coming out here I've traveled across country from here from California to the Midwest Indiana Chicago area three times by vehicle car and it is just a profound experience the the the openness is vast and just you have to experience it how you can explain it

 You know if I can get myself out there I do a little exercise
 that's really not to relax that's really to unwind and get myself out of the tension that I might be in

 what's something you feel guilty about
 not being more available to my son
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had
 wow that's a tough for me I've been following the hardest decision
 oh there was no decision in this this is but something that I'd like to relate erased from my memory was in that accident with my brother a long time ago
 I wish that had never happened to him
 have you ever seen
 yes
 18 baby didn't think so at the time though
 I just wanted to do something and that's what I did

 yes
 not at first but in hindsight looking back yes
 did you ever think
 in a manner of speaking I was in Korea when they stomped one of my Majors to death and from that point forward everywhere we went we went fully loaded meaning armed with ammunition
 no actual engagement With the Enemy though
 or what other personality or whatever you call it
 how is the weather
 very
 I never left it I was there as a worker
 and just really was a pretty much the same as just changing jobs now
 to do after the military
 went back to the job that I had before when I was working with the u.s. steel
 what is serving in the military change you
 don't know if it did
 if it did I have to say that gave me a
 appreciation or the opportunity to work with stuff that I never probably would have worked with him so I travel a little bit around the world and we're working on the Korea and that may be more aware and appreciative of all of the things that are out there I got a chance to see him and touch him a little bit
 how have you been feeling lately
 depressed
 no but I'll try to I
 living environment where people are insecure so homeless and environment and there's a lot of stress that goes along with that if you're trying to do something that's a lot of you know you're beautiful you don't you're not sitting with the other people because the downtrodden and
 that makes it stressful
 yes
 can you tell me about that
 depression and frustration
 with basically almost everybody that I've tried to confide in
 turned out to be treacherous and just not trustworthy or dedicated
 recently
 the same size if I get a lot of sleep in my own opinion but I think probably less focused
 less able to focus but not getting sleep lately has been tough or go to sleep okay but I just wake up in a few hours then back to sleep you probably a lot of other things too
 okay
 have you ever been diagnosed with p
 no
 yeah that was one of the questions on there but it is it needs clarification and that's why I checked know on that yes but it was I was part of an experiment with taking interferon and ribavirin to try to cure hepatitis and those those two drugs cause depression so I was chemically depressed as opposed to clinically and as a difference so there was some the psychiatric help and some medication to help me get beyond that 311 months of treatment with that it was tough don't recommend it to anybody interferon is a killer don't do it
 that treatment ended probably and all of the symptoms with it probably 3 to 5 years ago 3 years ago I think
 nightmare has intense itching
 thoughts of suicide and Vivid terrifying nightmares
 that's interferon
 interferon and ribavirin to drugs that they used to treat cancer and also in the treatment of hepatitis-c currently
 in addition to a third drug that they used can't think of the name of it
 how do you cope with them
 well I seem to be okay now has skin damage my body broke out in a full-body rash
 cause intense itching full full Ian golf the body for intense itching
 almost made me jump out of window but I held on
 the itching we're talkin about chemical cause being chemically induced as opposed to psychologically
 okay
 you still go to therapy now no
 do you feel therapy
 most worthless piece of crap I have a 20 out of 10 therapist that I talk to whoever said that the VA maybe to actually knew what they were doing or and then two were sincerely concerned about what they were doing the rest was just collecting a paycheck
 show me more about that
 well they were incompetent just asking foolish questions why I'm even we were supposed to be talking about some of my personal things in life and she was playing little games like sitting a person purposely leave the person on the table to see your nose still use using Psychology 101 the book bad about through the by the Numbers at the way that she was taught to proceed with someone as opposed to actually knowing how to proceed with someone if they just it was it was it was a funny actually actually funny
 sad
 that is over but the changes since going to therapy
 nothing you know all of that depression stuff kind of eased off and so I'm back to trying to do the things that I was doing before I took that 11 months to go in that experiment
 okay
 when is the
 in a long time
 I usually get a little bit of that daily somewhere I get a little bit of happiness in here
 just a little just enough to keep me saying I think
 there are elected without being you know listing of the risk of being casciac my father but other than that of positive influence in my life have been many mostly the men that I worked with while working it was a younger man
 there was some of the best the best work experience I've had in my experience is my 30 or 40 years of working with the team and ship those men and it was probably the same kinship that you would gain from being in combat because it was dangerous work and these guys looked out for each other they took care of each other I'm pretty sure it's pretty much the same way for a guy that experienced combat and the camaraderie that they had to have with each other because their lives were on the line
