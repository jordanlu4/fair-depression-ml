okay
and please
 are you okay with this yes
 I'm doing okay
 I'm from Greenwich Connecticut
 yes
 I moved here in 2008 so about 5 years ago
 I try to go back at least once a year sometimes I go more sometimes less
 overall I think I like where I'm from better than La in general
 that other than it being somewhere I'm familiar with the type of people that are there are just more my type and what I'm used to and less superficial
 I understand
 Monument
 all my move got here for college after I graduated high school and my mom and sister live in California
 initially it was easy because I felt like it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here it became more difficult than originally
 Fine Arts in photography
" I was interested in photography since high school
 yes I have a fine arts degree that I got last year and
 awesome
 are you happy you did that yeah I really enjoy working or interning in forensics I like that better than initially what I wanted to do was freelance photography I feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting
 Centrist in question
 I guess just my childhood in general growing up
 while my family is very close
 my extended family as well and they all most of them live
 within the area on the east coast in general so we would always do large family parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that
 yeah it is really fun and we try and I'll get together as much as possible which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries
 I consider myself more shy
 sometimes when I'm feeling
 hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got
 what do you do
 I watch reality television I think it's kind of funny and lighthearted
 like what I watch Like Bravo TV like The Real Housewives shows and
 like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to
 I'm good I guess I don't really have like a temper from having if I'm more stressed out it definitely shows in my attitude but I don't have like anger
 when was the last time you argue with someone
 will me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time just like about like insignificant things but other than that I had an argument with my dad a few days ago
 can you tell me about
 does Ben like some tension going on
 since I went and visited over the holidays this past winter things about his girlfriend and he thinks that I should be the one to make some kind of effort to
 have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways so for like the 30th time he we were on the phone and he was
 telling me how I need to call her and speak to her and I told him that I was going to do it over this past weekend cuz of the Jewish holidays and he kind of was just like very mature and telling me you'll forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like I could care less because I I don't care about having a relationship with her so she doesn't want to hear from me you know it's easier for me
 I mean every time I mean that's been the same recurring argument a lot and I wish
 that I could sometimes I do but I wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that I could just bite my tongue but the thing is is that he says certain things that are untrue or thinks he knows that like will take me off that are really nasty and that he shouldn't be saying to me so he so I kind of just like lose it and I can't really
 like not say anything
 well I guess the hardest decision I made which I didn't really realize that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to go after you graduate high school where you go to college because for me I've basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own
 so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like the progression of The Next Step but looking back now that's probably one of the hardest decisions I made
 tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
 I wish I could erase
 the event or seeing my grandmother's funeral which obviously it wouldn't change anything but
 it wasn't seeing her there was not something I'd want to like have in my memory
 come she was she was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental
 and now I mean my parents are great role models just in general I mean they're very successful people
 so whether or not we have like disagreements or that were separate people they kind of are good role models in terms of what you want to have when you are older
 usually it's easy the problem is staying asleep no matter how late I go to bed whether it's 10 p.m. or 4 a.m. I will be up like clockwork by 7:30 or 8 in the morning the latest every single day and I can't seem to figure out why I cannot stay asleep longer
 I need to record buy something no I just in the morning I guess I'm a lighter sleeper but I just wake up like I just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this is consistent but now it's I cannot remember the last time I slept past 8:30 in the morning
 I mean it just makes if I have to do stuff during the day and makes a lot more tiring but it doesn't really I'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of every day
 okay
 how you doing lately
 I don't know I kind of just feel very
 like so so just
 no extreme highs no extreme lows kind of one no land
 I mean nothing like lately
 like recently it's just I would say over a. Of years I kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and
 not very outgoing
 no
 no I have been diagnosed with anxiety
 I had some breathing problems for a day or two and I had to go to the hospital cuz I thought it was more serious cuz I couldn't breathe but they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety
 I think in the right setting and
 with the person who's doing it if they're open-minded and the therapist
 is helpful
 and good at what they're doing then yeah
 no I haven't been to therapy since I was a kid
 I went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me
 but it was never so I mean we just sat around and talked about my day wasn't it I didn't feel like I needed therapy at the time so I didn't really get much out of it
 tell me about
 I was happy when I was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the New Year's holiday when I'm there I can always just we save up our money so it's a complete vacation I don't have to worry about paying bills I don't have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow who I have to deal with I just do every morning we wake up we hang out just enjoy the day
 is there anything you regret
 in general
 I regret the college I chose to go to I didn't leave from the East Coast the whole Collegiate system is set up a lot differently and the university is out there or not the same as like the tight-knit California school system out here so when I was researching colleges I kind of thought that Santa Monica College was just a general College just like Boston College back home or you know any other school with the name college at the end of it I didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school like you you can't I didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when I went so kind of crate created more problems for me
 well cuz they're M22 if probably 10 years ago I would give myself the advice to
 probably stay closer to home and 2ave really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to California
 how your best friend describe you
 my best friend would describe me as a great charismatic funny outgoing socially enjoyable person which is different than how people who aren't my good friends would describe me
 which I mean I don't I mean it is what it is I
 I am very outgoing in and have a great time when I'm with my friend in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things I just
 I am very shy and
 don't really
 speak match
 recently my friend was visiting and we went to a Clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed that
 I'm very caring I am a very good judge of character which I mean I guess it's I mean I consider to be a quality for myself and various I mean never affectionate I'm more
 I mean I guess I guess so
 thanks
 experience I can chat with you a little bit more about
