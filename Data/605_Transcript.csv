 I'll just let you know the way it's going to work as I'm in a I'm going to leave the room and she's just going to ask you some questions and then when she's done she's going to say goodbye and then you're going to press this button

 yeah
 the weather and that it's a little bit laid back some people say that in terms of musical beat LA to little bit behind the beat or just little laid back
 it can be some people think that it's a little bit surface in terms of people's attitude I don't run into that that much I can't say that there's much I don't like these two days recently
 yes or no
 there's a meditation tape that has a fire burning in the background and then kind of stress reduction dialogue I listen to that
 people being inconsiderate or unconscious about their effects on others
 when people will drop trash without any regard and leave it for somebody else to pick up
 I tend to internalize it and try and move past it
 good
 good question
 it's been a long time that I can charge me to recall
 I think as a family dispute we were just talking about a disagreement in terms of understanding out something was taking place and having different points of view
 I just general education English math
 most recently as a cost and risk analyst in the construction industry
 probably these days we'll be riding
 I have in the past I love travel
 I love seeing new things and new experiences meeting new people
 I'm drawing a bit of a blank right now
 I think reasonably close I'm a little distant right now just cuz of circumstances

 oh just somebody who is an example of a way to move in the world and a compassionate manner
 I could be better
 yeah

 nope
 yes
 probably what's now going on maybe well
 yes
 not just having a persistent low mood and wanting to find out what that it was about
 yeah
 yeah
 Yap very much so
 it's so I just
 just an improvement in my ability to recognize some changes in my emotional state
 it's improved my ability to move through various emotions as they occur
 I'm sleeping too much not getting the same pleasure out of things that I normally got pleasure out of
 they can be sometimes
 how disappointments if when things don't go as expected
 process it go through and think about it and work my way through whatever issue it is
 good

 no
 next question
 terrifically easy very easy
 oh I can be irritable tired
 oh I think
 within the last couple of weeks I can't think of it the exact. Or occasion but
 oh

 I try not to regret anything
 that was bizarre
