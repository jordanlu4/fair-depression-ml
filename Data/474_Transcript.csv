 I'm good how are you
 I was born in Hawaii but I grew up in Colorado
 yeah yeah
 how about some 7 to 8 years ago
 I should go back once it once or twice a year
 it's
 how does it compare to La it's it's different it's not as busy there's more things to do outdoors in the mountains on my fan
 for work
 yeah I am I love it here
 it took about a year before I really felt comfortable but once they got through that kind of hard year it was pretty good out here but a good time
 I love that I can go to the beach I love that it's warm most of the time I love that I've met a lot of people that love the Arts as much as I do
 the traffic just like everyone else yeah
 yeah this traffic and it's pretty much just traffic earthquakes
 not as much as I'd like
 it's just nice to go someplace new experience something different
 I want to hear that
 I went to Alaska couple years ago and that was really awesome I got to go fishing in the ocean and I got seasick that was an awesome but it was cool I saw a bear in real life a bear walk through a yard is really different than La was way cool
 English creative writing
 well I always wanted to tell stories so it just made sense to work on riding and somehow some aspect
 yeah I am
 to have my own TV show where I write it and everyone watches it every week and it's awesome
 really hard
 cuz there's a lot of people that have the same dream so
 yeah
 more outgoing than shy
 I like talking to people enjoy other people
 take screensaver
 go to the movies or turn on music dance
 pretty good
 I was at work couple about a month ago about a month ago I got mad at someone because I didn't think they were they were giving me clear instructions and so when I try to have a conversation about it they got mad and then I got mad and we got mad
 I felt like I wasn't being heard or listen to and felt like we weren't able to have a real dialogue so because we couldn't have a dialogue I felt like no one was listening to me
 totally
 no ragrets
 I yes
 I don't know if there is one I mean I'm sure there is but one time I was driving behind someone and they will they cut me off and I think it's just been one of those days this was like a year ago or two years ago it's just one of those days where I just didn't want or I just been a frustrating day when this person cut me off and I almost got an accident with them I just followed them to their parking spot and actually I'd haunted them and they they flipped me off and so she's really really going to my skin would cut me off and almost caused an accident and then and then flipped me off so I followed them to the spa and I asked said Miss why did you put me off when you cut me off and and she said oh you know I'm I've had a rough day I don't need your attitude and her daughter was with her and I told her well you're not releasing a very good example for your daughter and you know I didn't need to be Petty like that but I just I wanted to be a guess
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to
 get you going deep is the hardest decision was coming out to my mom telling her I was gay I mean it wasn't hard cuz it was the right one but it was hard to do because my mom is very conservative and she she had trouble accepting and it it took a while but when she did you know everything is better and I knew it would be but it was just hard in the moment to you know tell her something she don't want to hear
 when I was little kid my
 my grandfather found our dog run over in there on the road and he
 and brought it in and buy them over as a kid just like seeing death like that really just threw me off and frighten me and I was just one of those moments but like I guess I wish I hadn't been there for it because my grandmother was destroyed she was just so sad and she was woman's I guess you need as a kid but I didn't really want to experience like losses like that in your face
 our relationship and our family is pretty good we find out as close as most but we do know we was we don't talk often but we talked with love and we always love each other when we see each other
 my grandmother was very positive she was always very encouraging and told me to you know pursue my dreams and not to let little things get me down so glad I had her
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep usually it's easy sometimes it's not
 wife in between jobs recently I start a new job next week but while I've been off I haven't been working I tend to like my body wants to stay up later and later and later and I'm trying not to like fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like 2 or 3 and getting up at like 11 so I keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or 12:30 and I just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half and I should be I should I should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like 9 but
 I want to stay up I guess
 a little scatterbrained like today I'm a little scatterbrained cuz I I tried to go to sleep early again and I ended up tossing and turning and
 so scatterbrained
 most of the had a lot of time on my hands like I don't usually have this much time on my hands so sometimes it can be frustrating because you don't know what to do with it when you're not working I guess but
 yeah I think that's the question
 I just thought maybe a little more absent-minded than usual just lately with the the not working thing
 no
 a couple days ago when I got my new job I got hired
 outgoing listening attentive fun loyal
 Bank
 help
 I wish that I
 I probably should have looked better I wish I had more hair up here losing a little bit if I wish I was a little skinnier this is girdles pretty tight and you know sometimes I wish I had more money but
 nothing too drastic I'm okay
 yeah
 hoo
 when I was a little kid I was I was the fly was the fat kid and remember I was like I was going to high school and it was like the second day and I remember this guy came up to me and was like he was like pretty nice to me I thought midnight realize he'd like this like out of a movie right here put Band-Aids on my back that's it like I'm a fat cow until like like yeah like just a bunch of mean stuff and I didn't know I walked around with it for like half an hour people laughing I didn't get it and then find this girl is going to me and was like hey there's like Band-Aids on your back that's Kelly's mean things and then she just walked away she didn't like help me take them off and I remember like I couldn't get them I was trying to find him and then I just never liked putting my head in my locker and like I didn't want anyone to see me cry so I just like what made out of my locker and like pretend like I was looking at stuff my backpack but really I was going to know
 the crying fat kid who can get the mean stickers off his back
 anyting
 probably
 yeah
 you know
 I would I would try to keep trying to let myself know 2 to look at things positively and not like we would have people think about you and I spent too much time as like a adolescent worrying what people thought of me and as I got older I didn't care as much and I start enjoying life a lot more so
 I went to Coachella it's a music festival it was 3 days with all of my friends and my boyfriend and we we danced and me went swimming and we barbecued and we laughed and had a great time
 oh I guess my MyCareer humble as it may be I really stuck in La a long time when it was when like it was hard I stay I stuck around it and quit so and I'm proud that I've managed to like follow my dreams and really stay out here and try to make it in Hollywood
 thanks for sharing
 my pleasure
 bye
 bye
 that was fun
 okay
