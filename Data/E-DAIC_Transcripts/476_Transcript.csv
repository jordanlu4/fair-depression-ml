set reminder after she says goodbye
yeah sure
 I'm all right I'm in a weird test study right now
 I'm from Los Angeles
 all kinds of different things to do in the city
 well
 I don't know if she Cherry is a little different and it's hard to get boring around here
 you know the traffic in the smog and all that
 I'm sure you can tell by my
 not as much as I'd like to
 money mainly lack of money
 I'd like to see in the world and seen all the different places
 Went to went to Russia 3 years ago
 I like to go into the church's we did a huge trip of all the churches in the area
 music for the most part
 I've been playing music for a long time
 are you still working
 yeah
 didn't musician touring performing musician
 really really really hard
 a lot of competition and luck involved
 I agree
 little enough
 getting probably just that I play a lot of music sit down with a guitar for a little while
 I would say good I think I'm a calm person
 I'm having difficulty even remembering
 nothing big in a long time
 I'm having difficulty thinking of one on the spot right now
 I have not sure I can't think of anything
 when you feel guilty
 guilty
 when I was a boy I stole a little golden bicycle from an old lady
 not proud of it
 I'm not ideal I'd live with my parents and 23 years old
 and that's becoming more and more Awkward
 I think
 I don't know I think things are improving I need to move out
 I need to get my own apartment and then we can come back around to be friends I'm sure with my parents
 there's a lot of positive influences in my life I've got a good group of friends you know my family I love them nonetheless but
 how is your day
 easy I would say
 what are you like when he died
 come
 not not as groggy as some people get it I don't know I'd
 just in general
 well and say things are all right
 nothing huge
 I had a really good band practice last night with all the friends I felt really good about that
 generally funny and good to be around
 work ethic I think is a big one
 sure
 you know I have a lot of projects that have planned for myself in my life and I have difficulty completing them
 I like to use space as an excuse that's my go-to one I don't have a good studio to record music or
 tell me about a time when some
 well okay let's this current band that I'm working with
 I was told I'm a part-time member in this band and I was told that
 you know I wasn't officially in the car group and stuff I feel pretty bad about that for a few days
 is there anything you regret
 in life
 maybe going maybe finishing college that might be something
 I know it just never I never came to pass that I would transfer to a 4-year University and get a bachelor's degree
 best qualities I think generally that easygoingness and good sense of humor
 play that I really enjoyed last weekend I went camping on a beach with a bunch of friends that was nice
 was proud of
 I guess you know musical accomplishments I put a lot of work into that and I'm finding success in my way
 thank you
