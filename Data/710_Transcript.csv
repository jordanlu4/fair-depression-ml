 you travel a lot
 not too much I used to in the past but not a lot these days
 how about working and going to school so it's kind of makes it difficult I don't really have the time

 classes
 do some electrical work and doing classes also do some residential and construction
 what's your dream job

 outgoing
 tell me about your relationship with your family it's a good relationship my mother passed away and fortunately but my dad's up north he's 85 and he stays with my sister now we all get along
 maybe take you a ride to the ocean and sit there and kind of look out to sea
 good I used to have a temper years ago when I was younger but I'm a little calmer and older and hopefully wiser these days
 I got you in trouble
 in the past it has but not as of recent
 to be honest I don't even remember that's how long ago it's been
 my divorce I guess so
 I guess I probably should have got it sooner
 I don't feel guilty about anything
 probably divorce whether to stay married or to get divorced it was a tough decision definitely
 tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
 I guess just seem death in the past and situations that if I could erase some of the visuals of that that would help me
 yes
 how old were you when you doing
 he was a 17 and a half
 I really wanted to get out of my hometown there wasn't much their jobs or advancement in jobs so I want to see the world because my father was in the military
 definitely yes
 okay
 did you ever see combat yes
 how easy was it for
 it was difficult
 because you used to a structured military life and then it come back and have less organization it was
 transition plus going from different places overseas and coming back in speaking English and not seeing the
 other people that you were stationed with so
 you missed some of those people
 hi
 gas station in Southern California my last assignment so I applied for the power company and was working for them for a while
 roughly twenty years
 more organization learn more responsibility kind of more of a manly attitude organization and discipline a discipline helps
 in life
 that's great

 good. Too bad mentally all right physically aches and pains
 I know I seem a little more calm and
 more tolerable of situations less arguing or none at all I just try to keep things
 less dramatic in and smooth in my life
 not really easy sometimes
 it's hard of sky can have some nightmares or just thinking too much and can't sleep or can't get comfortable or physical aches and pains so there's a lot that contributes to that
 a little irritable irritable
 have you ever been diagnosed
 yes
 thinking like 6 years ago 5 6 years ago
 I'm not sure I guess lack of sleep and chewing my nails and maybe a lack of concentration on some things
 are they triggered by something
 evidently
 that's basically it I mean I've been
 I have an experience that much as of recent but that was more like 5 years ago so things are better now
