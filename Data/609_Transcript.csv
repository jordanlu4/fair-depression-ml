 okay
 will do it
 can you turn up the volume just a bit
 can you turn up the volume just a bit
 find thank you
 where are you from originally Boston Massachusetts
 things you really like about a leg
 people first and foremost I'm very involved with the veteran community and I'm a chaplain answering my 52nd year
 things you don't really like
 traffic but that's true anywhere
 I see what you mean
 do you experience do you experience virtual traffic
 what do you enjoy about traveling
 the experience is the food the culture travel to 44 countries in my career
 I'd like to hear that one of your trips
 I was stationed in Paris France
 and travel to France Spain Morocco live in Germany is part of my chaplaincy service it was unbelievably exciting
 visiting SEC liqueur in that my Mart in Paris on my first day in France in Europe
 I graduated with a degree in Psychology from Boston College
 what do you do now I'm retired but I'm still very active as a volunteer at the prison in Chino women's prison and I can deck services at
 Jewish community that I stablished 51 + years ago
 what's your dream job
 actually I've been living my dream job since I was 17 years old serving in the chaplain city as a Jewish chaplain is what I wanted to do from the time I was early five or six years old I want to become a rabbi
 you consider yourself more shy or outgoing quite outgoing
 why because I'm able to be dropped into a room of 500 or a thousand total strangers and get to know them and have them get to know me without discomfort
 I'm divorced I was married for 16 years I have a daughter
 my she's been there at the light of my life my entire life I have a brother and sister-in-law and living back in Boston my parents are deceased
 sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got
 I actually have a fish tank and aquarium and instead of turning it on and seeing Virtual Fish shine watch the real thing
 I also like to go fishing deep-sea fishing
 I'm able to do that quite well
 when was the last time you argue with someone
 I would say it was a several months ago and it was about language
 dating someone and I thought her language was inappropriate and at first I thought I would say nothing and then I decided I should tell her what I was thinking and so I did
 that you wish you would handle differently
 the last time I saw my former wife she has created some legal problems for me and
 I was not as polite as I might have been
 I felt she was totally wrong and out of line it's been a very difficult and acrimonious divorce took 13 years to resolve
 that I in the last few years have not spent as much time with my daughter I was quite ill and ended up having open heart surgery and that was time when really she was abandoned I was always there to be buffer between my former wife and my daughter and when I was suddenly taken ill took me about two years to really become healthy again and during those two years she had to fend for herself from the ages of 15 to 17 difficult time for a daughter to be on her own with the mother who
 not as as nurturing as one would like
 that was the hardest decision ironically was going to do I have the surgery now and try to save my life knowing that I would be abandoning my daughter abandoning in the Lesser sense of the word we were still in contact but I couldn't be there to run interference for her or put it off and maybe suffered the consequences so I I made the decision to have the surgery
 tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
 the only real negatives in my life have been in connection with the divorce I never thought I would be divorced I always wanted to be married and have four children and the white picket fence now I got married and I had a child and had the white picket fence actually built it
 but that was the toughest thing for me
 adjusting to divorce I never thought it would have I nobody in my family on either side has ever been divorced
 yes I was in the air force during Vietnam War
 how old were you when you join the military
 17 I was going to go to Hebrew Union college-jewish Seminary in Cincinnati Ohio the war was raging in Vietnam and there was a need for chaplains and I was asked if I would serve and so I did and I originally thought it would be two years and then it was three and it was a four and then they had more time shows for years and two months I don't regret a day of it
 unfortunately I served in Europe not in Vietnam I was never shot at I never had to kill anybody but I really enjoyed my military service
 why'd you decide to enlist in the military
 why do they say to do what
 why do they say to go in
 yes going into the military was an opportunity for me to travel the world and do what I love doing and I've continued doing it for the rest of my adult life
 did you ever see combat never not a day
 but it was the luck of the draw when you put on the uniform you go where the government send you I could have just as easily been shipped off to Vietnam about 55 of the 60 people with who like trained went to Vietnam and fewer than 50 returned
 very high mortality
 I'm sorry to hear that
 how easy was it for you to go back to civilian life
 very easy because of the type of service I had it was as close to Miller cech's civilian life is one cat have
 started a business ran the business and while I continued as a volunteer chaplain and I've been doing that I still do it to this day
 alright I'm 68
 it didn't change me as much as it allowed me I guess it did change me at a lot of Peter broaden my horizons here I was coming from Boston basically a kid and I find myself traveling the world and in a very responsible position conducting religious services and teaching and working with other chaplains of other faiths a lot of interfaith work in the military
 marvelous experience I don't know anyone else who's ever done it quite the way I've done it
 I hold the record in Europe for on Passover we had 16 Passover seder is in 8 days in five countries
 why are you sorry
 how you been feeling lately Dracut
 tell me more about that
 I got a feeling good I've been very fortunate since having open heart surgery I've been relatively healthy and I'm very involved in the community and I enjoy every every aspect of that sometimes it's very tiring but it's a good tired
 have you noticed any changes in her behavior or softly I don't understand have I ever done what
 how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep very easy I usually retire about 11:30 12:00 at night and sleep through for 6 to 7 hours
 and it's usually as a result of being ill if I have the flu or cold or whatever then I'm sluggish the next day or for two days but I'm usually able to bounce back
 no I've not fortunately
 I've never been diagnosed with PTSD
 I've never been diagnosed with PTSD
 you're asking me questions that I've already answered that I've not been diagnosed with PTSD so they're not triggered since they don't exist
 can you tell me about that
 I just did
 turn of the frustrations of dealing with it a virtual person is your pre-program just so you're not asking the right question
 tell me more about that
 what is your next question
 you feel therapy is useful I think it is for some people yes probably for most
 tell me more about that
 I think it's a very useful tool and many people have been successful in receiving therapy
 many of the veterans with whom I live in work I have had extensive therapy and it's proven to be very successful
 changes have you noticed
 I haven't been going to therapy so there haven't been changes
 all right
 when was the last time you felt really happy
 yesterday
 went to a birthday party there somebody 85 years old and there was a great great granddaughter who were just celebrating her first birthday
 it was a fun day
 yes it was
 old number of people
 a number of rabbis and people in the clergy generally
 all of them 20 or 30 40 years older than I and that's I was growing up they were my mentors
 how your best friend describe you
 active
 vibrant dynamic
 I always having a full plate
 follow through if I start something I finish it and if I make it commitment I honor it
 tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed
 I'm connected Services a week ago Friday night and then this past Friday conducted services at my own community
 we had a wonderful musical time both times
 yes it was you would have enjoyed it
 we didn't have any virtual people but it was nice
 my daughter and the accomplishments I've had in my career
