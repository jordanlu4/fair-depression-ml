hello
 she seems nice
 boys size 10
 when she says goodbye
 okay
 yes
 all right little tired
 awesome
 I grew up just outside of Philadelphia and I move to Los Angeles I'm almost 5 years ago
 weather for sure also I was a film major in business minor in school so I came out to be involved in entertainment
 traffic smog some of the people are a little flaky but I generally like la
 no quite the opposite I consider myself an extrovert
 enjoy reading
 get a glass of wine perhaps throw on an old movie try to get out of the apartment and maybe take a walk something like that
 cruelty
 people not using their people being careless or thoughtless you know not really giving consideration to other people when they knew things
 usually vocalize my annoyance like unless I figured would be really inappropriate in the moment but I'll usually let somebody know as gently as possible then I'm kind of annoyed with what's going on
 usually pretty good but I also you know there's like a limit point where I go past and it's like that I cannot control it really anymore so I have a long fuse but
 hadabah large amount of dynamite there sometimes
 I had an argument with my girlfriend recently and it was
 you know we're very different communication Styles so
 I guess
 I was not feeling heard and she was not feeling like my response was appropriate at the time maybe
 I was a film and media arts major and business minor and I actually got my masters of Business Administration it
 right now I'm looking for work preferably something entertainment-related but I will take anything that will help pay the bills and let me continue living on the west side
 I what I really wanted to do was to produce films so that was sort of my concentration in the film major and I did a couple of internships for production companies as an undergrad end in in my master's program and I like working with creative people and developing stories and developing projects and being the person that can go from the business and legal people to the creative people on try to make everyone happy and make some money
 I tried to I mean I'm a little low on funds right now but I really enjoy traveling I drove cross-country when I moved from Philadelphia to La so I drove down the east coast to Savannah then all through the South and the Southwest I've been to England four times I've been to Continental Europe twice lot of the islands Montreal
 it's only place I've been to in Canada but a lot more of the US and also Asia Africa Australia those places I've not been to yet but I'd love to go
 what's a may be the first time I ever left the country first time ever went to Europe we got to take the train to Glacier Express through the Alps in Switzerland and was unbelievable with the snow and things like that and I took a lot of pictures and I don't know if it's one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen so really sticks out in my mind
 I'm very close with my parents I talked with my mom on the phone probably two or three times a week I just talked to my father for Father's Day the other day and you know he always he sends me emails of news things that you found interesting or stuff that's related to
 film and things like that so I'm close my sister like I have a niece and a nephew on very close with them I talked to my sister a decent amount and I always see them when I'm home for the holidays but they're all in the Philadelphia area so I'm I'm not physically around them only maybe once a year twice at the most if there's a wedding or something like that
 there's been a lot
 definitely my parents some of my teachers in high school and that sort of encouraged me
 like my social studies microcultures Professor my one of my English teachers my phone program I did a summer internship program twice and they had one of her professors for my film
 101 class like was the moderator for that so kept in touch with him as well
 I like it a lot better now
 my last roommate was only you somebody from the MBA program also was a year behind me and he was a terrible roommate he just moved out so I was replaced by somebody else who is
 Young and nice and he has the money for rent and he has a rabbit and he's just like he's a pretty cool guy so got a decent-sized place I've got the bigger bedroom of the two and the rent is not too bad and I get to live like in Culver City Mar Vista side of town which I really enjoy so I like where I live and the rent is not bad for the neighborhood not at all but a little broke right now so I got to get back working again and and
 calm down the the money situation but the living situation itself is fine
 I have one roommate yes
 no I have not
 yes
 well I mean I guess in college I was seeing a cognitive therapist for a while
 but I've never medication anything like that and I kind of got away from it but
" last summer but about a year ago
 so I guess a year
 yes
 I had a DUI which you know all of my drinking I think was really predicated more about the depression not being able to handle that properly so that was part of it and then just the stress of school he was having problems they're having problems in my relationship and you know is that okay really low point and I felt terrible so I decided I should probably do whatever I could do in order to get better
 okay
 not took a leave of absence from school so that's not really available to me but I still go to like a surprise sobriety support group and you know if they're going back to school to possibility so I might John go back to doing the counseling sessions there but my health insurance runs out in like two months so I don't really have I won't really have a way to see someone unless I see Department of
 health or something like that so we'll see
 I definitely think that there people that are probably on medication that are not in therapy that probably should be I'd rather do therapy without medication the medication therapy that is for sure so I definitely think it's a it's a positive to
 speak with something on a regular basis who is sort of removed from your life and objective about it and
 don't just listen that's really the most important part is I'm coming to listen
 yeah me just having dedicated time of like an hour or so you know 50 minutes whenever two or somebody gets to listen to what's going on with you and and offer some possible
 guidance in that direction you know in the direction you want to go I think is always positive
 and force you to be like more mindful of what actually bothering yourself when you have to vocalize in and tell them what you're feeling and try to help figure out why and what you can do about it I think that's always a good thing
 that my mood has been a lot better
 that was a really down black time that last oppressive. So
 it's been a lot more. Like the future and what I'm doing and
 the way I'm thinking about things and it supposed to just like stumbling through an existing I'm like trying to think more about what I really want to in what I believe in the things that are healthy for me and
 all the stuff in the should be should been doing before but wasn't
 I'm settling in for the Moon
 I wasn't drinking often but when I was I was drinking to get drunk I was very very down there was some weight gain I was sleeping a lot to enjoy as much and I was worried about money I was worried about where with recommend I decided which I still am to an extent but it's not like bringing me down so much now
 caught up in a down. Like a rut that I couldn't get out of
 I think it was probably just
 not feeling successful in the things I wanted to do and I just got swept up in the day-to-day of like oh well I don't have a job and I don't have any money and I'll try to figure it out and I'll do this interview and that's not going to really delete anything and it was just a very
 you know I wasn't moving anywhere wasn't I was stuck in one spot like that
 about not drinking
 I'm just to let you know try to be a little bit more mindful of what I'm doing and why I'm doing it you know if I get if I end up in back in school again I'm going to definitely take up the counseling sessions again I don't know if I want to be back on medication I don't like that was good for the time frame it was in but I don't have to become everything or just good I'm trying to get back in shape now I join the gym and figure that's going to help me to but the main thing is going to be figuring what to do my life cuz I'm 30 now so I feel like I'm to get the real career started
 okay just really worried about the money situation because I don't have the student loans to fall back on anymore and stuff so I'm pretty broke pens doing it again
 nice
 probably more positive now I would say in general I still love that The Temper switch like I'm I'm still on
 the same things that bother me in the past still bother me but they're not permanently like getting me down there just I would be upset about something in the moment and need to express that and then figure out a solution or Let It Go as opposed to staying in that funk so I can more resilient definitely
 yeah most of the time
 like I said if I do get upset about things I'm not somebody who likes to keep things inside
 but even getting Mountain Pass wouldn't really get me through them you know would be something I'd really have to slog through it would take me down for sure but now I feel a little bit more comfortable with feeling I'm feeling and getting a house and then trying to work through it
 some days I do you know but it's not everyday and it's not like for no particular reason anymore I mean I may be down because I'm stressed out cuz I have such a problem that you know I need to address in the in life like my lack of funds right now and you not trying to get in bad shape and you know trying to figure out what to do with my education that I have so far and find what I want to do like that something that people should be worried about but I don't feel like it's any anxiety or anything like that as we know our sadness or fear is dominating anymore
 how is your day
 I'm usually okay I've been
 going to bed later and wake me up later and since I've not had a job so that is something I need to watch out for cuz I really need to start waking up earlier in order to apply for things and go you don't meet people in person and try to figure something out on the job site of things but I'm I'm sleeping okay I'm not
 being Sleepless or anything like that there are definitely some days where I feel like staying in bed sometimes but
 physically I feel okay
 that sucks I mean I've definitely I almost feel like I've liked cold symptoms 5 only get four or five hours of sleep or something like that I won't know the runny nose I'll feel a little feverish I'll be hungry at weird times like I'll just be very run down and I did I don't like that feeling at all I try to get likes every 8 hours sleep every night
 probably when I was home over the holidays for the holidays I could spend half my parents and my niece and nephew and my sister and I got to see some of my old friends I got to see some of my extended family generally good feeling and is also my mom's birthday on the 27th of December so that was a fun occasion as well
 I would say very intelligent very funny a little bit too intense a little bit crazy but nobody loyal also generally a
 a good person a nice person
 I work a lot of things in my life I've done some things like that to you I definitely regret that you know I dropped out of the first college that I went to cuz things are really going badly for me at that time and I kind of regret that I think it might have been the right thing to do but I wish I would have been nice to be able to finish school you know on time and start a career that way you know I generally try to behave the way I would feel couple sleeping at night after work but you know everybody fails it something so anytime I've lied any time I've caught something any time I've felt like I've wasted an opportunity
 she's inquisitive
