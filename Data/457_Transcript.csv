turn on
yes
 spectacular this is an interesting experiment
 I am from middle of nowhere Iowa
 May 2nd of 2007 so exactly 5 years at 6 years ago and frequently like once every couple years
 the weather exist so it's more extreme and then it's exciting
 winter in Minnesota
 I took approximately
 the drive-in that's that's about all it took the lights the lights took care of the rest
 I really love that it's a giant concrete playground at night time so that bicycles have free reign of the streets I like all the art I love the fact that there's so many different kinds of culture jammed all together and then if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here
 oh you know the traffic the exceedingly High Cost of Living
 I'm sure you can
 not nearly as much as I would like to have been a little bit
 I like not knowing exactly how things are going to go like the fact that it forces me to
 deal with people to deal with situations in ways that I normally wouldn't have to
 last year I got to hang out in San Marcos for a little bit after I split up with my ex and then after San Marcos I went back to Iowa for a bunch of family stuff and then I brought my little brother to Los Angeles
 last week managed to go on a bike ride for ciclavia
 as I use basically a Rolling Green Light the entire way down Venice Boulevard and so he made me made a bunch of like national news and was all over the place but the rest of us as his support group riding around on topics and stuff they we didn't bat an eye we didn't blank because it has normal for a friend that wasn't even the most absurd thing he's done lately I was just at a happy normal Sunday but our group of friends is so unusual that a normal Sunday for us is Extreme for everyone else
 I used to be an introvert but definitely an extrovert the last few years thank you Los Angeles
 once I found the right group of friends it was easy to be social it drew me to be social extroverted even outgoing
 bombastic for the first time and it stuck
 if I weren't already the most relaxed guy already I would probably do things but when I'm really stressed out I do all sorts of stuff
 usually I tried to enlist my friends call me doing art project
 what temper
 panics cuz I really wanted to make him not hate me and I mostly failed
 hard on him I mostly unless I got by with a couple of scrapes on my Hugo
 when when that all went down I tried to talk to him but I got distracted for the very first time that day and so instead of
 having my rubber gloves up I managed to take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over trash cans it was not my most graceful moment
 something you feel guilty about
 I feel guilty about lots of stuff I feel guilty about eating more often than everything else
 because I really love junk food it's really good and I have very little food will power these to be that guy
 tell me about the hardest
 I'm not sure what the hardest decision I ever had to make was made a lot of hard decisions
 I guess
 it's very hard to leave Los Angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff but I wasn't even that hard cuz it pushed me to do it so
 tricky questions
 oh you know Brooke collarbone severe pain get surgery on the LC like the time
 tell me about
 know my numbers are important I have lived a spoiled blessed life and if I changed anything then it wouldn't be the same universe I like this universe
 little brother lives here he's awesome he's actually right outside waiting for me my mom is crazy and my dad is crazy everyone else is crazy I'm pretty crazy
 but
 since most of the rest of them live so far away and don't have to deal with them too much relationship is positive and sparse
 jackrabbits been pretty positive influence Mi lately she is a magical creature
 well there's a part where she's intensely physically beautiful is the part where she
 manages to hit me with the best inspiration words there's the part where she
 actually works on the exact things that make me excited there's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance and then there's the part where she is 100% kind and caring all the time
 all of those things are really nice but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that
 she does this all
 without wanting anything in return
 smitten
 what a funny question how do I know them as though she's multiple people how did you know I know her through my
 bicycle friends
 the hard part is going to bed but as soon as I get to to sleep land time pretty much there until an earthquake hits so I can get to sleep
 poorly but then I'm a pro at it so it doesn't matter
 less verbose and that's about it my dark circles get slightly larger and I'm pretty much the exact same dude because I've been doing it most of my life
 so stoked that I might as well be on fire
 because the universe and its infant
 I suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor has managed to convince me of the reality of magic in the Archer City Park Simon's ISO
 as a fortunate and
 vaguely aware being it's my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this
 yeah my excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate and feeling more and more inspired all the time if I could just work on the motivation I'm beside
 have you ever been
 not since you asked me on the phone a little while ago now
 I know I used to think I had it but who knows at this point those while ago
 I was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then I moved to Los Angeles and started having fun and then the rest is ancient history
 2013
 working on my shoes this morning was really nice doodling on our project that all my friends helped him put on that's that was pretty nice that's a nice feeling
 awesome
 a very good question I'm not actually sure I'll have some later today though
 I guess I'm
 Susie Astic I am
 historic and I am
 I'm going to have to say highly analytical
 be nice if I could get my superpowers back would be pretty cool
 like turning on some of the fancier finely-tuned and delicate Machinery that Chinese medicine has clued me in to inside myself
 to play tough one I think the thing that I'm most proud of would probably be
 I'm not actually sure
 00 all sorts of stuff I'm working on that
 don't masturbate so much
 what are some things that you
 Jackrabbit really bad puns and dessert
 no problem
 hi Ellie
 okay
 what a hoot
