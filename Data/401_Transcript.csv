where I am
 try to see look like someone I know
 no problem okay
 okay alrighty
 hi
 are you okay
 yes I'm okay
 I'm good I'm a little tired but I'm good
 Michigan I'm from Michigan
 a long time ago
 then I laugh
 once twice a year
 compared to a
 cold very cold
 because I wanted to pursue my acting career
 how did you do
 well it wasn't a hard decision it was just it was the weather it was the opportunity it was the options more options
 the driving has been a pain in the butt not so easy
 blesse
 besides the weather
 I like that
 things are more convenient
 I like some of the people here
 that are actually from home but
 yeah and I just I like I like that it's a little late back
 that's about it
 I don't like the traffic I don't like
 the gang violence in certain areas and I don't like
 I like
 maybe that's that's all I don't like
 I don't know you know I like I don't like that it's so far away from home I wish I wish La was kind of Midwest I wish it wasn't so far from home
 have a close relationship with my family it's a small immediate family is really small and we're closed my grandmother recently passed saw it some and adjustment right now but I'm close to my family
 okay
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot
 well I can't see your shoes but I do travel often
 I do travel yes
 I'm getting there I like getting beer once I'm at the wherever I'm going I like to actually do the tourist thing get to know places and people
 okay I will owe I went to I'm France few years ago well many years ago and a little town called Carcassonne and was very
 it was it was actually really fun but very much like a storybook as far as what I expected to seeing what I actually saw like what I remember that I really enjoyed was that at night when everybody closes up like there no windows in the buildings but they are the shutters that most places in the United States have inside of Windows they have them outside of the window there's no glass so you just shut and it looks like everything is abandoned like the buildings are abandoned so pretty cool I like that
 I'm borderline sometimes I'm shy sometimes I'm outgoing and depends on who and what the situation is
 music I turn on music I walk
 through the neighborhoods now
 I'm pretty good at controlling my temper I'm not a hothead at all
 oh it was annexed roommate and it was about my loyalty as a friend
 can you tell me about the
 yeah pretty much gif
 I thought that because I wanted my rent what she agreed to pay that I was not being a good friend that I should just let her live for free
 that wasn't going to happen
 so you know the Loyalty came with letting you stay anyway or letting her stay anyway even after she didn't pay me so that's a friend I could have kicked her out I didn't
 she laughed at the agreed time after she let me know that she was not going to pay but she could have
 could have been a bad situation but there was an argument there a real a real one
 I wish I had handled that situation differently and follow my first mind when we agreed to be roommates temporarily and gotten my money up front that's what I wish I had done and I just I didn't my mind told me to go along with it
 no my my told me to get the money up front but I didn't
 so
 the hardest decision
 I think I have yet to make the hardest decision but so far like
 maybe leaving home
 leaving home when I was years ago when I was like 18
 yeah
 I felt like I was abandoning my family that's what I felt
 but I'm very encouraged me to go on and live my life
 something that I could erase from my memory
 probably a friend who I was on
 dating I would like to erase from my memory how he responded to me when I told him my grandmother was ill
 how is your day
 I'm it's easy if I'm busy all day and I'm really really tired but actually my mind spins so
 it's not that easy actually it's not that easy
 I have to because I have to
 be exhausted
 I have to be exhausted
 to be exhausted now it's not really hard you just do a lot of stuff all day long
 irritable
 up and down
 I've been up and down like sometimes I've
 then excited and anxious and on the other side I'm like
 what am I doing
 I need triggered by something
 you're just a nature sister want to make some things happen
 some goals
 getting certain kind of work and
 having a certain amount of income and
 just taking care of myself do you know the way I think I should take care of myself just the physical stuff
 eating right and everything
 yeah I have
 can you tell me about
 sometimes I have a lot of distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what I need to be focused on in the moment and I'm conscious of that him like of all the things that keep popping up in my head why am I thinking about that
 I let them happen and then I try to think about other things and FaZe it out pops back up I phase it out
 I know
 now
 when the roommate moved out I was really happy when she finally left
 tell me how you spend your ideal weekend
 I'm probably reading and maybe go I'll go dancing that would be ideal I can go dancing salsa dancing and yeah
 what are some things you wish you could change about your
 my ability to make a decision quicker and to act on it
 really badly
 I don't know if I have a time to someone has ever made me feel really badly I don't feel bad about much
 as courageous
 I will be at in a nutshell
 in general
 I regret not making some different decisions when I was younger as far as moving forward as far as career stuff and relationship things I wish I had done some things earlier in my life that I'm doing now
 I'm really going after some of my personal goals and
 deciding to actually be in a relationship that's long-term and yeah I wish I had done that earlier
 20 years ago I would have given given myself the advice to continue with my schooling beyond what I did and
 to be more Discerning in my choices of individuals who I allow in my life
 being a part of the family that I'm a part of
 thank you
 goodbye
 I didn't know if it went
