 hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today
 creative
 are you okay with this yes
 I'm doing good
 I'm originally from Southern California
 I like the downtown Theater District I like the beaches I I like the variety of stuff that you can do in one day
 well sometimes I don't like the traffic I don't think there's really too much I don't like about La I really like it like that oh
 no I haven't really travel in about 5 years
 oh I just haven't been able to travel
 I just haven't travel
 I like going to new places and seeing things I haven't seen before and if I can like visiting places like landmarks
 I want to hear that one of your trips
 well the last one I did was San Francisco that wasn't so far but I got to stay in downtown San Francisco and I got to go shopping and I got to get on him the streetcar so that was cool
 well I still study I'm studying psychology
 well
 I decided to go back to school just pretty quickly so I went to Junior College and then when it got close to graduate I knew I want to transfer so
 I taking a couple psychology course is not decided I liked it so I just decide to make that my major and I thought I didn't have a lot of math but it had enough math
 are you happy
 well now that I'm almost done I don't know if I'm going to continue in that area
 dream job
 well would I wanted initially was to get in the sport psychology but I'm not quite sure that's what I want either
 okay
 you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
 well I have to be shy initially but once you get to know me I'm outgoing
 what I'm feeling
 I turn on the fish tank screensaver I think I either go to sleep eat something really really good or watch something on Netflix
 like what what does a good movie I like four movies a lot so a lot of right now I'm into martial arts movie with subtitles so
 I think I'm pretty good
 when was the
 you know I know
 they're not really long arguments I don't know if there were arguments I know I argue with my boyfriend and he hung up for my face so I don't know why and it got soft pretty quickly so I don't know if it was really that important
 when I walked out without saying okay
 I can't think of one right now
 I think
 the hardest decision I probably had to make was moving from will back to California from Oregon
 can you tell me about that
 but I was really young so I was
 19/20 and I was really by myself so that was pretty hard cuz I obviously had to support myself
 what made you decide to do that because it was a really really boring in Oregon so I really like the activity here in LA
 what's something you feel guilty about
 you know I don't really feel guilty about many things
 okay
 tell me about your relationship with your family
 well I don't talk to them that much my dad and my stepmom live in Oregon so I probably talked to on the phone at least once or twice a month and then when I come out here I want to say at least once a year sometimes you can be twice you know occasionally more but not too often and I see them about it but I'm pretty much the only one out here my brother is also up there as well yeah
 what have lots of positive influences I think I'm just regular people are come across you know maybe someone off work with maybe I'll actually my uncle he's a really good positive but he knows quite a bit has lots of good advice
 like what about life
 you know I don't really think I've had anything that bad happen to me where I just don't
 what bothers me so much I have to not think about it
 well I can't say pretty easy cuz I work schedule and then I go to school but
 I want to go to sleep I sleep really well those long as I have enough you know hours
 feeling lately really really happy and good
 nope
 no
 always happy hour yesterday
 I'm just happy anytime I talk to my boyfriend or if I go out and do something I'm just happy I got off work I'm happy cuz I'm done for the day I'm just really happy I'm on spring break I'm really happy right now so
 awesome
 something you did read
 oh I haven't done like any really extremely fun activities unless you consider going out to eat but the last activity that I had a lot of fun doing with ice skating in December 10th in downtown LA
 is there anything you regret know I don't really have too many regrets I mean whatever happens happens and you know was meant to play out that way
 advice cuz you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago
 well
 I guess I would say don't worry too much about the small things
 even though they seem really big it really they really are insignificant and you won't think about it in 6 months from now
 okay
 I think my best qualities are I'm a happy person I'm a fun person I'm pretty easy to get along with I think most people like me and I'm just a cool person
 well I wish I could study more I wish I would study more I wish that I would exercise more and I wish that I think that's it right there
 tell me about
 I don't think I want to talk about that
 okay
 what are you most proud of in your life
 I don't know I guess I'm just taking care of myself supporting myself not having to go back home I guess that's about the best accomplishment there is
 thank you
 bye
 okay is that you and the other end
