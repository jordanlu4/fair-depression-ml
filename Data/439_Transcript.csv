 the environment has changed over the years I've been around since 1952 and I was born here in Los Angeles and I see such changes as far as environmental with the smog and basically that's about it
 I'm sure you can tell them
 I've judged several places in the United States yes
 trying different type of Cuisines I like to go to museum like two historical or a historical buffer going somewhere different than where I've been here all my life
 I'll let me start with both try Boston I had never been to Boston before and when I went I was able to look at the Historical the buildings and I went to I saw the Lake Charles and then the boats and stuff with it it was just it was a good experience and it's another place I went to I took a ferry in it and my mind went on blank on it I can't even think of it right now but other than that New Orleans I didn't go to the Mardi Gras just I don't like to go when it tomorrow to growl when they have a lot of people I just went on the offseason I enjoyed that and I've been to Atlanta Georgia
 and I have taken a cruise went to the Caribbeans I took Mexico cruise by next cruise I like to go to the Alaska because I want to be able to see certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet as far as their Environmental
 I'm outgoing
 as far as going places I don't have a problem eating alone I don't have a problem meeting people
 I'm only shy and conversing back and forth to a stranger
 oh I have a favorite thing I like to go on the internet and I like to do sweepstakes I'm a person that loves to try to enter in a lot of contest and I've been very successful since I was a kid I've won a lot of sweepstakes and in the evening time I find our time and I just go online and just I'm so good at I know just about exactly the right time to even entering I usually try to answer them before midnight when everybody else is asleep so it's been successful for me
 getting married having my children
 I have a 27 year old son and I have a 31 year old son both of them when one of us married though it's not and I just not too long ago became a grandmother I have one grandson and my son he works for the County of Los Angeles assessor property conveyed convenience as amateur and the other one is the computer engineer So and I've been married for 33 years and strong
 you don't want
 if you build a foundation with your children and have a good relationship with them and talk to him and find out what's going on and tell them that you love them on my son I talk to him all the time when he went out the door I love you and even today when they're call me and hang up a said Mom I love you you always have to give them that that good feeling when they leave the door that you care and I never had to go to head to any jail to get them out they've been pretty obedient I mean boys will be boys but I never had any problem as far as them getting into any serious trouble and I'm very proud of that especially the boys I don't know how it would have been different but
 avoid if I have to say it was pretty obedient and they respect the law
 the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you and I've watched my son like I said just grandmother and I watch him how he handles his son and it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home on how the hell his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey I got a wife I have a son and it's my job to make sure that I keep a roof over their heads so it tastes off
 and I asked nicely he treats her well
 my mother was more Stricker on me but my parents for some unknown reason I guess because I have my sister and I were the girls like they weren't struck on the boys but they were more strict on the girls so they didn't let us go a lot of places and then my parents are so they weren't typed it like to travel and I used to look at them and say no I'm not going to be like that now I'm going to travel I'm not going to just stay home and I don't mean that is nothing wrong with him because they
 downtown love is home and do things at home but they never really travel anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one and I used to try to talk her and get on a plane and go somewhere and she said well I'm going to go here I'm going to go there but you never did she died she never needed to do any trouble so I made up for and want to do something different in the next two to travel more than and be more out there I was more of a social butterfly my mother was not a social butterfly so I made up for it
 I think before I speak and then I am the type of person also to take on other people's feelings before I blow out the wrong thing I try to analyze the situation first because sometimes you can put you open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you would not be able to get out of
 it's probably something about my husband yet I know it was this new construction that my husband is working on our house
 we had a disagreement on that then have their own way of doing things and I had told him not to use a certain person to work on our house but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead and now he sees all the downfalls and he didn't listen and so I didn't say I told you so but I guess you can tell by my facial expression that he'd have done wrong and I told him I said look you losing money and it became one problem after another so now I'll do a construction thing is up in the air right now cuz he knows he has done wrong and I'll but he doesn't want to face the fact that what he knows it but he doesn't want to really face it back so he says I look smart project with our project
 so I grabbed this one of the biggest arguments are we having right now that I can think of this recent
 I felt that he didn't really listen to me and he more so looked at cheap or economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways cuz I told him that you need to do your research I'm the type of person I do my research before I jump into something I asked tried to. My eyes and cross my T's but my husband he's not like that he's fight I can get this person can do this project for x amount of money and he's a good friend of mine so I don't care I mean is he license he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he could just jumps into it
 witch costumes some extra money unnecessary money that is spent on the end I mean it's a lot of money and so I was really very upset yesterday I was very upset about it because it was just wasted money that we could have say can we wind up doing the same thing all over again and it didn't make any sense
 I retired early I was very fortunate to retire at age 50 I retired in 2002 I was working for the State of California Disability Alice and what happened was I was able to reason why I was able to retire so early because I've been working since I was 18 and I had like 31 and 1/2 years of service and we was so nice about it that I only needed the best in like 10 years in my health insurance so I was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire I've been with kelp her and I know if you have a counter but if we have excellent retirement system and since I have been working with them so long
 I didn't get the full percentage I should have stayed Thomas 55 but I got out of that 50 and I didn't get the full amount but that's okay I found myself going back doing a little part time job because of the economical reason and then I have one eye that's so
 I think that was the kind of mistake I did I should have kind of waited till I was 55 and 50 but I look at it now as far as the health insurance I really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up and I don't pay very little money so I think that over the gates of the money that I receive
 you see the hardest
 I probably when my mom died cuz I'm not used to anybody dying and my mother died in 99 of non-hodgkin lymphoma and
 putting her funeral together my brother and sister we never we will never face with anybody dying of putting a funeral together and all response because I am the eldest it was put on me and I'm like oh my God what I do is so it's kind of like trying to find her insurance policy cuz I had asked her to make sure she put everything in order and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and try to get all the stuff together and finding things you know I myself I keep my things organized time for some unknown reason she didn't have her Sargon eyes and I think that was the hardest and knowing how much I have to pay cuz I had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff and I'm fortunate my mom this is interesting she had one of those small Barrel insurance but she had $1000000 of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with no accidents he had
 local conditions so that was something that we had to pay for the whole just about everything
 yeah it was it was but now I can handle that this is something weird but since that I've learned from that so I'm I have made it available for my children that my husband died we got together and we want him getting our insurance policy. Insurance policy but what do you call the Bureau Insurance be at that and it's just that we've had it for many many years so it's almost payday advances 10 years of pay for everything and everything and nothing that I did I've even written my own obituary I know that sounds weird so my son make one phone call that I don't want them to go through what I went through and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on and he said he don't want anybody to have any problem people
 I didn't tell him what to do it's already written we did a living trust it's nothing they can do but make one phone call and that's it
 I have no problem sleeping very well
 pretty good
 I didn't a little tired but that's only because the physical condition I have found out I have vitamin B deficiency in vitamin D deficiency self is more physical but not mental
 exercise walk walking more saw
 no not really
 no
 no
 I'm basically happy all the time I'm more so I'm making other people happy I get more phone calls as people want inspiration about things when they have projects they working on and then I try to encourage them and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey I really appreciate your input thanks and then they are I'll follow up on them and see how they're doing
 resource person I've been described as a resource person from my supervisor to from my friends because I'm the type of person I research everything I get into just about I just don't dive into any situation I tried to look up information some I know if we have the technology here that you can get everything on the end of that but I also go back to the old school like that like even finding this place I mean I did the map Google but also I love the Thomas brother I never going to give up my Thomas Brothers map Yellow Pages you be surprised I Don't Give Up by Yellow Pages so there's certain little things that I don't really let go I know we have technology sometimes she's going to be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff that even though technology get you have it right at your finger but you can find things and then they say I'm more
 Barbie first person the most people come to me just to just look up things and I get that that's as Funk about it because I like to look for stuff and find it
 and that gives me satisfaction
" I wish I could have stuff going up and down on my way to lose weight diet before the summer time and and then by Christmas time I have what they call a yo-yo weight problem and if I can stop binging and making food my friend I think that's it's a nervous disorder I did I like to eat and but also I don't like to be overweight either cuz I have plenty of beautiful clothes at home and I can't get them on right now so I know I saw them when we go on this bench and try to lose weight for the summer time so I can get a no so nice
 I'm sorry I didn't hear you
 no not really I was ready and I can stay skinny again back on
 I see you and I'll be home by 10 or 20 years ago
 I would have stayed a little bit more money before I retire
 instead of retiring too early
 what's Providence is on my life
 meeting a lot of people that came in my life I got good friends I still have 15 of the best friends that I went to elementary school and in very where you can find anybody who can walk around and say they have the same 15 group of friends we were in the sorority together went to college together lived in the same neighborhood and matter fact we just had with all of us and our 6-year birthday and our high school group we put together a 60-year birthday reunions and hear all fifteen of us with the exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so I think it's basically keeping the same friends I think we can probably outlive me
 okay
 you're welcome bye bye
