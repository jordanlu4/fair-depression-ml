 it's been a positive influence in my life
 very easy
 grouchy
 not very nice
 yes
 how long is
 about 2 years ago
 I don't like crowds
 loud noises are people being behind me
 almost a general fear of people
 when I don't know what their intentions are
 maybe their actions or movements
 maybe we sometimes what they say
 can you tell me about that
 growing up I started in gangs at about 13
 and I seen a lot of bad things happen and since I didn't have a great childhood I was never home I was more in the street sent home so I'm
 I seen some things that kids shouldn't have been exposed to and therefore I got involved with some things kids should have been involved in
 that's something I regret also
 can't believe one peanut sauce
 prayer
 a lot of prayer
 since I've been in recovery
 I found what some people call her higher power I believe in God
 growing up I really didn't believe there was a god
 not by what I experienced in when I went through
 can't believe won't be in this honest with a character
 it's brought me peace
 piece of my life something I needed very much and I enjoy
 I can't take it no more I was tired of being locked up going in and out of jails prisons
 I've been arrested so many times I lost count
 the lifestyle that's why I meant about the lifestyle being in LA
 it worried down if you don't die first so
 I got tired of living that way
 y'alls becoming-animal at times and
 you become less than a human being
 it's no way to live life
 it has its moments
 yes everyday
 except Saturday and Sunday
 you feel better
 all very useful
 gives you away Tom
 figure out your feelings your thought process
 Channel your emotions it actually
 how to teach you how to deal with your emotions and
 can make you aware of what brings out certain emotions
 sharp pain in certain anger issues
 things that you weren't generally talk about
" just like I'm here talking to you right now normally I would never do something like this in fact I'm
 I generally don't trust people so here I am talking to a virtual person I know somebody on their side who I have no idea who you are and
 before this would never happen I wouldn't I wouldn't be as open as I am now cuz I honestly believe it's none of your business and anything I had to say you could only use against me but now I'm running recovery have nothing to hide I'm not proud of things I've done
 I've learned to accept them because I can't change them
 for the mistakes I've made I'm learning to be a better person
 in some ways I think it's made me a better person and people who haven't been through what I've been through because they have less compassion I can feel more empathy for others and compassion for others because of what I've been through compared to someone who has it
 I stay out of trouble
 I'm more trusting cuz right now this is really just is it really messing with my head seen her talking to you
 this is really a trip I'm peaceful I don't have my anger issues no more no hostilities no
 no more dreams
 last time I talked to my son
 about a week ago
 that brought me a lot of joy
 fifth grade
 so my counselors also some of the people that I've been in therapy with all of us are
 veterans Raikou therapy so a lot of us have been through some really traumatic events and
 some of us are really overcome me some
 deep issues in a positive way which is on
 it's really
 how my best friend describe me
 my best friend hasn't seen me since I've been in recovery so
 he described me as being loyal
 honest straight up
 but I
 volatile
 wouldn't take nothing for nobody no Flack
 but a good person to have on your side always loyal
 get some for my roommate he's dying of a disease where his brain is deteriorating slowly he's only 30 years old and I'm
 he inspires me because he's got such courage everyday he's always in a good mood even though he's suffering from Life suffering you would never know so he inspires me so a Time song
 I tend to feel like I'm
 I want to give him something back. He gives me so much everyday so sometimes I'll go out and I'll buy us a couple steaks or am I know he loves cheesecake it's all gone game cheesecake because at 30 years old to be suffering from the disease face suffering from where his brain is deteriorating slowly so he's losing all muscle control is starting to lose his eyesight this is like a slow killer which will progress and speed I guess as time goes on but he doesn't last long down and he's always good people now.
 that inspires me to be a better person so I have nothing but respect and love for him so in turn
 I try to do whatever I can for him
 sometimes when our vets are trying to push him around us or white stand up for him cuz I don't believe now he's a little guy so I don't believe in no way push around other guys
 thank you
 Asiana accomplishing that you not really
 that proud of you
 I'm working towards that but I
 Aussie everything I've done so far I feel like a
 it's nothing really I should claim as being proud of you know even my changes I made it's just a part of all being a decent human being as far as
 actually doing something that I feel like it clean and proud of
 I haven't reached a plateau yet I hope to that one day
 thanks it's been interesting
 goodbye
