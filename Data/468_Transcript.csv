yes I'm okay with this
I'm pretty ass a little tired but some pretty good for the most part
 on Redondo Beach
 yep
 at the beach or the mountains I love it go surfing in the morning or snowboarding the day
 if you're hiking up in these mountains Santa Monica Mountains to be exact
 I don't like the traffic I don't like the congestion a few people here and I don't like
 the price of the cost of living in specific areas
 I'm sure you can tell by my
 I've been trying to actually
 last year was the summer of really Road trippin and getting out there if my girlfriend
 we're looking at a Costa Rica and hopefully South America this summer and then maybe even doing a road trip down the South Seas in the southern states but I've been in a Canada been to Mexico and Ecuador iron
 been to various States here and they're trying to get out there
 I love meeting new people I love experiencing new things trying different different foods that are native to that local area and
 she's part of the journey I just I love exploring this you know this planet we call Earth
 just recently went to Seattle and Canada with a couple friends and
 who's gorgeous we have flew into Seattle and we saw the city for the first two three days and then rented a car and headed over to Vancouver Canada and saw British Columbian why was he gorgeous just very large beautiful trees the
 the climate was nice the ocean was right there's people are great it's just a fun trip all around
 one of my most memorable experiences
 was probably the
 the trip we took the Colorado last summer and me and my girlfriend flew into Denver and we didn't really have a plan we knew we knew of a couple people were living there and just the day before we had contacted them and tell them we're coming the area and they're just showed great Hospitality they picked us up at the airport lettuce crash at their place for a couple days we even let us use their card it's for the state and go to Wyoming and see the neighbors to the north it was just a great trip great people and it was just everything worked out very well just everyday is there something new and fun to do
 yeah
 I study business management and economics right now
 I'm I've always wanted to own my own business and I figured Mansion PA
 Agera Foundation to build on and I'll learn more about so I decide to go to management just to see the various aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and then economics was just too just for long-term Investments are really want to start running some stocks and ETFs and mutual funds and start building my profolio up so I figured now that would be great way for a long-term investment financially so that's why did my economics
 yeah I'm really stoked was
 one of the best decisions probably mine my life
 I consider myself more outgoing them I'm pretty friendly hiking don't mind to open up to people and stuff
 how to be outside like to go hiking want to go working out the gym but I most like to be outdoors I love nature and just be outside just
 just puts me at ease
 from pretty good for the most part I'm pretty mellow chill guy and when I do get angry here and there
 it just lasts for like a couple minutes and before I know it I just it just blows over I don't tend to hold on to things or stay angry and hold grudges just cuz there's no need to Life's too short for all that
 see I can't remember the last time I argue with anybody
 I have no idea
 probably when Maya
 my brother and my girlfriend got a little little argument I'd like to birthdays ago and it's been awkward kind ever since
 I wish you would just handle that right then and there rather than letting it just stretch out as long as it has been it's just awkward for both parties I was just go to communicate with both of them and told them that the differences aside and was just communicating try to come up with a solution
 but now it's just awkward
 yeah it does
 tell me about the hardest
 the hardest decision I've ever had to make
 and the Tuffy
 I don't think I've had too many tough decisions really say the hardest decision I've ever had to make on maybe
 not moving to Colorado for my undergrad to three years ago was a little touch of slick kind of think what if
 but other than that nothing has really been too tough on my life that was really that hard of a decision
 when you feel guilty
 don't really feel guilty about anything pretty good person I think and for the most part I can think of any then
 so now I could wish I could erase my memory
 nothing really be honest
 I love all my memories are usually positive for the most part I know it's kind of
 wait for somebody to say but I've looked pretty good life and
 I'm happy
 yeah
 it's cool I'm pretty independent the most part so when I do see him here in the ants if we go through long periods of times with no contact maybe a couple weeks sometimes even a month but I want to see if it's good you know I like to say hi and show him I love him still and it's not that I don't mean to like not contact him that you're always contact me but
 it's good for the most part I guess is a young adult
 my girlfriend's family
 they've been very positive in my life I wasn't for them I think of you in a different direction
 just in high school I didn't really care about higher education I didn't care about
 really thinking long-term
 and I just seeing them and what their family dies and how they think differently like through higher education and how to get somewhere in life and if you do these things is to work at will you too and they've been very successful they own their own no accounting practice and
 seen that influence me to achieve higher in life
 pretty easy for the most part I just close my eyes and
 wake up in the morning
 I'm tired sometimes
 it's enzyme a little drained and
 maybe a little groggy in there
 and that's it
 showing pretty good for the most part a little stressed out just cuz finals around next week and I really really want to do well and just seen a close out this last semester and I graduate in two weeks and for the most part that's that's one thing I'm really nervous about but for the most part I'm really excited and looking forward to going to Maui for a week after graduation fired up and fired up to see what the future holds we're going to be my girlfriend 11 weather trips are planned for the summer I'm just excited be done with school for a little while
 yeah
 I have never been diagnosed with PTSD
 I've never been diagnosed with depression
 the last time I felt really happy with paci my girlfriend graduate couple days ago she had just graduated from nursing school on Monday and I just hear walk across stage and stuff just cuz we've been together for 6 years Tina go through the nursing program for 5 and it's just ups and downs it's really good to see somebody just drive through and Achieve what they wanted to cheat and just been really proud of her
 yeah
 probably outgoing friendly Positive Vibes all around adventurist
 love sports team player knows how to be a leader in there
 and it's a little outspoken sometimes
 not really for the most part
 no not really
 feeling more motivated to do something motivating right now I'm just because I'm just done with school and I'm over at that I just don't feel as motivated but I just want to be more motivated and determined
 right now and that's not
 I'm not going that way right now so
 no biggie
 how man I couldn't
 can really think of a Time
 Owen caving 2 weeks ago that was a lot of fun we went up to Sequoia National Park and I went caving with the trainer CNA classes like this site Recreation tourism management class and Kayden with an elective and our professor was at the world-renowned cave specialist and they took us to these various caves in the Sequoia and just me and these strangers are my classmates and becoming really good friends with him was a lot of fun and rappelling down in a cats climb back up going through different rooms and shoots it was a lot of fun
 Dallas yeah
 10 or 20 years ago I'd probably say to stay more focused on school little lesson the social aspects and kind of stick with one sport to see how far that he got you
 sometimes not playing hockey hockey sometimes
 and that's pretty much at now
 I'm proud that I'm really proud that I'm graduating my bachelor's and I'm looking to get a full-time job or get a law firm now so I have something going for me
 really try to be motivated and determined person long-term long-term thinking lies and well-rounded person
 and I don't want to spoil the world some car proud that I open my eyes to that and now I have different perspectives and really about open-minded people and rather than judging I mean on Celebrity why not let them do what they want Anna
 I'm really proud to just be a finally getting my Bachelor's and hopefully going for my MBA in a couple years

 for sure
 bye
