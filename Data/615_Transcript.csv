I'm going to have you alert me to look up
 sure sure the algorithm
 still see her for a second I'll shrink your back download
 another thing to mention is that
 church so I won't ask questions
 sure
 no problem
 so I just answer the questions
 ChaCha
 okay
 sure
 okay
 yeah I'm ready I'm cool
 good nice day no traffic to get here
 so you have no complaints
 the East Coast
 well the weather is fairly consistent I like the surfing probably the most I like about it allies the surfing the beach surf can't do that anywhere else
 traffic flaky people
 you're a different culture than the East Coast education's more valued back East so what I don't like is probably the personality is people here in traffic
 not currently but I have traveled a lot in the past but currently not really traveling
 changes the environment seeing different yo meeting different people that different cultures obviously depending where I'm traveling from traveling to Orange County it's not an entirely different deal in here but I mean like your upper would have would have you just different cultures different environments seeing different things
 but obviously you couldn't see from sitting at home in your couch
 David I've been to Europe many times in 2003 I went to Europe for several months just traveling around and I went to places I've never been before like Scandinavia and parts of Eastern Europe and I was interesting cuz I'd never know the typical Spain Italy London France trip I've done a million times but I've never been to Scandinavia which is a little bit different than Western Europe and obviously Eastern Europe is very different to
 oh gosh many of them
 that's a tough question cuz I've had many good experiences traveling on
 okay not that particular trip but running with the bulls in Pamplona Spain that's very memorable which is actually going on right now as we speak
 history and political science
 trade basically so yeah wholesale trade if you will so buying selling
 so I guess you could say distribution
 equipment my main job that is my main job so I guess it's Logistics you can call it so basically the logistics of moving goods from point A to point B Freight forwarding you could call it
 many different variants of it
 I'm outgoing
 because I am not shy I can talk to any stranger in a room on the street I'm not really afraid of people that I'm I'm not nervous or afraid so I'm comfortable talking to strangers
 not that I'm going up to every person on the street and having a conversation but if I'm at a party I don't know anybody I can strike up a conversation very easily
 it's good. But I'm the only one out here my family lives on the east coast and in abroad so but with technology it's easy to communicate with the email Facebook Skype so even though distance wise
 separated it's pretty much easy and free to stay in communication
 I know it's not
 whatever like to yeah I just to relax and avoid stress I go surfing big stress reliever
 I go surfing and it's pretty intense pain can be dangerous and that relaxes me
 cuz what I'm in the water and when I forgot whenever I was stressed out about
 enough looking it up screensavers going to do it for me I got to do something physical
 I'm going to control my temper I'm I'm a very controlled person so
 I'm not
 you know for real for my buttons to get pushed they really have to get pushed so I don't even have a temperature control so
 it's not even an issue
 oh probably politics
 are you over politics
 you know the current administration his opinion versus my opinion
 oh
 there's probably met a situation handled differently I don't know
 that would probably be something related to relationship personal relationships
 Damien
 I feel guilty about
 push-up guilty about
 probably having wasted you know
 I feel guilty what I waste time
 what I accomplished nothing and I waste time that makes me feel bad
 soccer question
 hardest decision I've ever had to make probably breaking up with a girl
 that breaking up with a guy with a girl
 yes
 22 23 22 23
 I wanted the
 action the excitement there is a war a conflict going on and it seemed like the right thing to do with the time and
 it seemed
 like that was more of an important thing to do then yes it in a job working
 are you happy
 yes I would do it over again
 a little
 it was easy I mean the transition was easy after I made a transition by going to graduate school after the military to ease into that transition and that was a that probably made it easier than going right for the military right to civilian life so I had a transitional phase for several years
 started working
 go after the military I'm sorry after the military went to graduate school and then I started working
 I wouldn't say it change me because it probably just fine-tuned whatever I had I was an officer and so you can't let go in and you're not going in when you're 18 you're going in after college so you got to have a little bit of discipline to go in and especially the branch that I went in so it didn't radically change me it just basically you know fine tune me
 you couldn't go in if I maybe if I wanted 18 it would have been something different but it did just fine tune me
 no there's nothing to be sorry about
 fun
 but I've been feeling fine I give you stress just looking anything but I intend to have a good way of managing stress
 cuz I guess I'm used to the stress so I can guide have learned to manage it well
 Troy study changes in my behavior enough
 love you hey I'm pretty consistent so like my behavior is radically changed
 music for you to get a good night sleep
 that
 that's hit-or-miss sometimes
 it's easy and other times extremely difficult so I'm Hit or Miss. I wouldn't say it's always easy for me to get a good night's sleep but
 hit or miss so it's like every night I can't go to sleep but I
 if I work out enough and surf enough I'm tired enough that I just sleep regardless so I guess it would say it's moderately easy for me to get a good night sleep
 if I exhaust myself appropriately
 otherwise I'll have too much energy too much on my mind that I'm able to go to sleep if I
 worked out enough surf for 4 hours 3 hours literally I'll be so exhausted that I have no doubt I'll fall asleep on the couch so
 if I don't I'll have a lot of energy and I'll get antsy and I have a lot of thoughts going through my head when I'm laying down at night. It'll be hard to go to sleep because too much stuff is racing through my head
 so what I got to do what I didn't do what I need to do
 I don't sleep well I just I'm probably I wouldn't say I'm like you're the bull I'm not an irritable person but I just feel like crap so I'm probably not as happy when I don't sleep well
 can I get a good night sleep and my body feels like crap if I don't get a good night sleep
 you tend to eat at me personally I tend you eat worse when I don't get a good night sleep
 I don't feel as good
 physically
 no
 felt really happy
 plus I felt really happy
 but I got an answer the question probably don't know about a month ago I when I caught a really good big wave I felt really happy when I cut this big wave
 surfing of course it is absolutely
 yeah I'm never upset or pissed off when I'm surfing I'm very happy when I'm surfing if I catch a big way very happy
 funny extroverted a lot of energy
 oh yesterday I can say surfing again but I'll keep repeating myself yesterday I went to Hollywood do a independent bookstore where they had a book reading and I was kind of cool
 oh yeah
 like my achievements that I was in the military
 Maya
 physical abilities I'm very proud of so I've worked hard to be able to
 yo I do what I can do surfing and other things I'm a very good athlete I'm proud that I'm a very good athlete cuz I worked hard to be a good athlete
 yeah. I guess I'm proud that I'm an intelligent person to not just whatever born with an innate intelligence but fairly well-educated that and I worked hard for that so I'm proud that I'm an intelligent person
 cuz it was some work involved yet to get to get there
 sure anytime
