never had that doesn't matter okay
 start a conversation
 okay
 go back over here
 when she said she'll let you know
 hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment
 and please
 are you okay
 sure
 I'm doing good how are you
 Chicago
 yeah
 about 25 years ago
 yeah it's been a while
 actually haven't been back I like Ally I like la
 it's a big city so it's kind of similar but the weather is not the same so got to let la for the weather
 family I was a child
 you took a little adjustment but not hard
 the weather can't think of anything right off the bat but I sure wouldn't want to leave so my family is here so that's another reason why I wouldn't want to leave
 traffic
 not really but I've tried to shove a little bit yeah
 seeing new places different people the way they live their lives
 my went to Monterey California earlier the middle of last year that was very nice
 it's a good question I'm not really sure
 probably
 I can't think of anything right off the bat which makes me think it's kind of weird but
 astronomy
 yeah it was
 I don't know just kind of fell into it took a course liked it and then took some more and I just went down that path
 no
 there is not much job opportunities
 it's kind of limited
 yeah it does
 my dream job I would like to own a restaurant a nice butt bar restaurant
 can you tell me about
 I'd like to have something a little more upscale than most places you go to released in the area that I live in most places don't seem very kind of just seem like a dive bar just kind of worn out run down so something nice something different something creative something vibrant something for you know tracks of crowd
 but it's probably cost Lisa I don't know if it's really possible
 I'm definitely more shy but I can be outgoing when I'm comfortable with people that initially I'm pretty shy
 good idea
 a lot of times I try to just lay back and you know do some deep breathing just kind of clear your mind or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book that is just takes your mind away relax
 I've gotten much better at it I used to have problems with that when I was younger but I'm good I'm good with that now learned that you shouldn't react immediately to situations you should you think before you speak that type of thing
 when was the
 my ex girlfriend when we broke up about 3 months ago
 we're relationship just wasn't doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and wasn't really it wasn't a memorable argument that it was it was an argument so that's all I can think of and I haven't really seen her since so that's what it is nothing special just a typical argument between two people who drowned separate
 frustrated
 like I guess everybody kind of sees things in their own way and do you know my way in my perspective is right and I'm sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that you love your ideas or what you're thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody's kind of looking out for themselves
 oh yeah
 that's a good example right there with the with my girlfriend I didn't have to I could have reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion there's been times in my life where I got into arguments with friends or something like that were you know or previous relationships where I probably shouldn't have reacted the way I did you know not that I did anything bad but just more of a you know be more mature about not you know reveal your emotions so much for that type of thing
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had
 leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when I was 18 is it a long time ago
 I went to school in San Diego and I immediately wanted to come back so
 I kind of ruined our relationship and we're still friends and I wish I didn't do that
 what's something you feel guilty about
 I feel like I can contribute more to my family and my friends like I think I could do better I think I sell myself short so
 employment opportunities are hard to come by but if I can find a good job and be a lot more happy because I can provide for myself and others so not be so much of a burden to people around me
 yeah real difficult
 tell me about your relationship with
 good very good we're pretty open with each other and I see my mom and dad and my sister quite often so it's good relation I mean we get along very well could be Demi is not perfect but it's good
 pretty easy I'm a good sleeper
 I'm probably irritable or harder to do tasks it's kind of like you feel like you're being strained or something because you don't have as much energy and
 how did the feeling lately good relatively well spring time always makes everybody feel well
 have you ever been tag guns with p
 no not at all
 never
 really really heavy and you we all feel happy everyday at some point but really happy probably been a while
 if I like Super Bowl Sunday I was with all my friends were having a good time so it's been probably like a month and a half or something when I was really really happy
 I wish I was more
 I guess
 stuff to my goals and I wish I had better drive to succeed I don't know I usually settle for less
 I don't know I guess that's the calm demeanor part of me that's good and bad
 don't really matter I kind of live in the moment and then you kind of realize that 5-10 years ago on by and should have done something
 I'm just going to stick to that argument with my girlfriend three months ago she made me feel pretty bad
 tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
 I don't know when I was
 when I was in high school I got into an argument with a friend and I drove my car too fast and it was an area that I didn't know and I hit a turn that I didn't know I was coming and I crashed my car so I wish I didn't do that but that's a long time ago so it's not a big deal now
 stupid immature
 my parents some of my close friends I have I have a good group of three or four friends they've been positive influences
 caring guy nice person good heart
 little little unmotivated needs to improve on certain aspects of his life to
 make himself better and passionate I guess passionate in a good amp
 I care a lot and it's the same time sometimes it gets the best of me
 can you give me the
 sometimes you feel like you know you're doing more for your friends or somebody like that
 you're doing more than they deserve and you're not it's not being reciprocated
 so that's an example
 yeah probably but I can't think of anything off the top of my head
 focus more in school because while you're young you have the ability to multitask and
 something you did recently
 I don't know really enjoyed I mean I do things everyday that I enjoy but really enjoyed I don't know
 I cleaned up a bunch of stuff in my room so it's nice to shed some old garbage so that that was all right but don't know if I really enjoyed that I feel content after it
 what are you most proud of in your life
 how much it's makes kind of sad I don't know I think I could do better I feel like I'm Underachievers so I don't much I don't know
 I'm very detail-oriented organized I like to finish tasks I care a lot and I'm very caring
 I have good intentions in mind I don't like the wrong people I don't like to lie because once you buy one lie leads to another so I don't like that
 but yeah that's that's about it
 cool
 right on have a good day
 hey those weird I felt like I was in therapy
 so take this offer
