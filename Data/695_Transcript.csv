 I was yesterday
 it was about children playing
 one of the veterans took it upon themselves to Starlite stock two or three other children anticipating that they were in the wrong and he was going to take it upon himself to correct it when it was not his place so I got into an argument unless you're an argument but leave the babies alone that's why we fight and die in order for them to have this kind of Freedom so let him be

 and
 I feel somewhat welcome home now when I didn't do when I got home for maybe 20 or 30 years living on the ground and all kinds of things
 I feel some would welcome a little bit
 without a maintenance typical
 it's difficult. I'll say it like that even with a major still
 without Seroquel I might not go to sleep at like that
 lately I've been doing the best I can to try not to use it to go to sleep
 and there's a small bit of success there
 few hours Leslie but still successive not using it and going falling asleep
 waking up quite often but still yet and still without the medication falling asleep
 with both eyes closed
 what are you
 feel like I'm back in the war zone
 quite attentive
 very serious
 and wondering where I belong at that time what should I be doing

 other than maybe I'm still in Vietnam sometimes are you still in me I'm already a bit but it's in me
 seriously
 very seriously
 even if there was no such thing
 as opposed to matter stress program
 for the sake of self-preservation I need to to research my own psychological profile the best I can

 try to apply some of the solutions space cleared
 philosophy
 metaphysics
 prayer
 meditation
 the safety of my family
 from me
 I hope to reach Marines be reinstated and some kind of therapy my 10:00 is too I haven't in the past year I want to go back into therapy
 I feel like I need to
 all the things that I think is may not be the way that I see things may not be correct
 my prospective just maybe offer on I don't know so I need other people's feedback and I'm starting to learn I do need other people
 do you feel therapy is useful yes
 in a feedback circumstance are situation where and getting
 live feedback from Men of the same experience
 maybe not the same individual experience but the same experience Over All
 seeing someone else's perspective of the same view
 intrusive thoughts are not as not as profound
 speaking out and realizing that there is quite a deep problem helps me realize I need to dig pretty deep it's an inside job
 has nothing to do with his what's happening outside of me is I'm merely but as I thought when I first came home not to be welcome home to be a baby killer the Beast fit at all those things determine my decision-making which at this point now I realized it's what's happening inside of me not outside of me that makes the difference and that's making the difference
 when was the last
 every day this past two or three months
 and it's frightening
 and I'm trying to find figure out just how to feel about it
 thank you
 I would say first of all mr. grey for establishing The Village Cabrillo and all the things that benefit the veteran and welcoming home
 who is the property manager my case manager
 and so many other people that are involved in my healing
 I appreciate them I'm loving the fact that they're there and are here for me
 so that I can be here and there for someone else when my turn comes
 I would say my best friend is my mother
 and what a best friend I'm just learning how to be a friend I don't really know how cuz we weren't allowed to make friends over there we lose them and then that would hurt so bad
 not to know how to detach
 so I learned exactly how to stay detached from feelings and people
 practice it so long difficult
 I don't agree with you but that's okay
 we can agree to disagree on this one
 talking to a virtual reality person
 this has been an enjoyment to a degree
 find great
 because it's challenging mind
 imagination
 learning to live living to learn
 and apply
 without you
 the knowledge wisdom and understanding that I may have
 I think I've asked
 thanks for sharing your thoughts
 thank you for asking
 goodbye
 going to push the goddamn button now
 okay
 if you can just
 yeah if you can walking back over so I have to sit through nothing
