alright cool
I'm doing good what about you
Los Angeles but I couldn't even recited Inglewood
 we did I answer your question I don't know
 okay
 La the murals the ocean what else the people my family is over here so that's the best part
 what about you
 I would say the smog yeah the air had to be cleaner and yeah
 that's what I mean is good people bad people too but yeah for the most part it's all good
 yeah I've been in Mexico and the temples and it was in California so yes
 traveling like Tina are that's good healthy for the body cleaner blood flow the people culture and stories and then come back you share stories with like your friends
 yeah anytime like right now or when
 okay so I just one time I was a kid we went out to the temples and it started raining so we just start walking through in like when we get to the top one thing I didn't know before is that the higher you go does the smartest steps get so like people back then had on a smaller feet so what happened was as I went higher towards the temple I had to walk sideways so my feet can measure up to that the steps but once you get up there tonight to you
 I am
 general education but mainly art yeah I took a lot of art classes
 well when I was a kid I scribble and walls with Crayola so I figured you know like it kind of stuck around with me so I just posted it so yeah
 my dream job would be to get paid for painting painting art
 yeah
 yeah pretty simple
 it's not so much that it's hard it just requires passion persistence and faith and well you just have to really believe in yourself to yourself the more likely you are able to succeed
 I consider myself to be shy and certain time of places but I am also outgoing when like I have the energy so I feel like it's well-balanced you know like I'm shy when it's I guess okay to be shy you know and I'm outgoing when like the need to actually have fun or just explore feels good like if I make sense but yeah
 screensaver
 yeah
 2 hour relax
 either well I'm going to say this but I smoke weed so that helps and I like painting painting humans help me relax you know blue on relax me and also green when I use these two colors and make a painting account calms me down
 I didn't have a blue shirt yeah
 my temper well my thoughts and my thoughts control my emotions and my emotions yeah scream until my temporary getting mad or if I do get mad what will be the outcome you know so control my temper is just like training my thought
 the last time I argued with somebody was with my with my father and it was because I wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine so right when the food was ready I was hungry eating you like nope so that kind of frustrated me and the way I handled it was like well I could just eat when I come back and I'm doing him a favor so you know and then after you not to eat and eat in peace so yeah
 my family is pretty good my mom and dad have a good relationship and still married and my brothers and sisters we help one another out so that's good it's just yeah it's a good team
 a situation I wish I could handle differently would be
 that's a good question I mean can I get scenario
 okay
 situation and kind of differently what you got something I feel like if I'm calm in any situation I could figure it out you know but if it came down to like a Rubik's Cube maybe how to handle the situation would be just buy a feeling I'm feeling making mistakes because I don't make the right mistakes and the right lessons will come after so that's the best way I could answer your question you know yeah
 deposit influence pretty much anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence influence you know like yeah even though it may hurt like all the truth does hurt well they're not trying to be mean that actually
 good influences I was in my friends my mom and dad my brother my sister's yeah
 we'll see that's the thing like I have I've had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife but at the end of the day with that did was like give me more insight made me more aware and it taught me how to read people a little bit more like dispense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kind like scar me a different pair me for like the world you know because it's happened to me when I was like 12 13 years old so if everyday could be exposed to like you know like guns nice and all that stuff so it's it's bad but it's good in a long-term you know because if you get out of that slump it's like nothing else would really phase you because you think you might have been through worse so it's not as bad as you know and
 so yeah
 the hardest
 this one right now I don't feel like answering when I got stuck I like kind of think I was part of it but Hearts decision as far as like life-changing
 life changing whether to continue school college or not I kind of chose
 to like I went to school but I chose to pursue my own like
 like I'm there any more advice can I give myself with people who are already in the field I want to be in so that was a hard choice because there was no guarantee that I would like run into like the right people but I took that chance you know I'm at the right people so
 yeah
 yeah yeah
 how easy is it for you to get a good night
 actually really easy I sometimes like I could sleep right now in like 10 minutes you know I just like like soda my air pattern
 lately I've been feeling good I've been feeling like I have free will like at this point in time I feel like if I chose a path any path with like my heart I could get there you know but I'm kind of like still deciding if I carry sing in August pass or in the air or should I make my own I don't know that's why I'm at I feel like a free will
 oh yeah
 ladylike in the past 2 weeks or today
 okay yeah you know like
 yeah things happen that would change like my feelings and
 example right now they just happened right now like
 this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought because
 yeah it's like it's technology you know it's like it's a trip to see how far I like one could take a thought and then make it reality so that's kind of like shifting my thoughts right now this experience this whole experience
 yeah
 post-traumatic stress disorder no
 depression I know how it's like to be depressed but diagnosed by a doctor no
 depression
 how how it feels
 how does depression feel like it feels like it's like a bird in the cage being depression is like being a fish who can't swim in the water have feeling depression is like being A Bird Without Wings pretty much it feels like you're limited but then a thing is to get out of that depression if I get to awaken and change your perspective and focus on
 like I would say colors colors help and people talking to people helps
 yeah
 being depressed
 16
 I don't know like it could come like it to happen everyday like it's small doses doses so like I could say today you know earlier when I was just by myself I felt a little depressed then what happened I fixed it like a cut up a friend and met up with him and yeah
 I mean at this moment I feel pretty happy you know I'm talking to average person is pretty cool and yeah right now if you're happy
 sometimes hard headed like you would try to teach me a certain investment whether it's art or just like in my character and yeah he just described me as like like like Listen by the same thing he'll still do what he wants to do but it's so pretty much like I don't know
 yeah I mean that's what he tells me but your overall good person
 I just exercised my diet food my food intake and yeah
 health
 I would say when I was like in middle school or in elementary little bit too but yeah it would be was it would either be about
 will Pumas my heart like something and I thought it was good and then someone else be like all you know that looks kind of like like trash and then I'll be like oh damn I could accept and be like yeah it does kind of look and then fix it or why would do back then we'll be like damn you know you're going to do well and I thought and then just like stay there for a bit and then eventually I'll come out of it but yeah you should use bone people's words
 and ideas that yeah
 yeah I said it
 regret yeah I got a couple things I regret
 like what well sometimes I feel like I should have completed the whole university thing but I mean at the same time I feel like if I really wanted to go I would have gone
 so yeah that's kind of regret my head
 10 or 20 years ago would be on seek spiritual well-being you know learn how to handle your thoughts to your thoughts I will teach myself pick the people you surround yourself with because that definitely has a major influence in your environment Street events you experience and as far as your overall happiness
 yeah
 among other things but yeah
 I'm most proud of right now is my paintings I'm proud of that because like I feel like depends on releasing are things that no one else could duplicate you know it's like it's one of a kind of Nikes is there you know is Sazon signature something so yeah I'm pretty happy about that
 yeah thank you
 are you thinking
 alright bye
 yeah
