 outgoing
 tell me about a time when someone
 probably my boss said he's pretty condescending
 and I'm really likes to belittle people and put him put himself as the king so he leave had a lot of comments to make himself build himself up and the little whoever whoever else is in the room
 usually when you go in he likes to brag on how much money he's made in the business and then say things like go see was how much better I am than you are you
 look how much money I've made this year in and you're the worst piece of shit agent there is
 things like that
