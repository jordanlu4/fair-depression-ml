 yes
 I'm pretty happy with what I'm I'm doing I do Consulting so I write marketing plans that sort of thing
 it's really hard
 about writing a marketing plan
 I know it's hard it's hard to talk to someone about who's not marketing it requires just knowledge of you know how it's how it how it's done and it takes several months to to do lunch
 well I guess I'm originally kind of shy but I become more outgoing just cuz of work and stuff
 I like to exercise I do hiking with my dogs we walk up and down a hill a couple times is that
 good
 I don't remember
 I don't know nothing comes to mind
 sometimes I don't I don't clean my car it might get lots of dog hair in it and I feel bad when I tie should always stay on top of that just getting to the carwash and stuff
 well I had a conflict with my brother and so I had to decide to have an estrangement from him and that makes the most sense in that was a difficult decision but just because of his angry behavior wasn't it wasn't that difficult but you know what it was somewhat difficult because I I love him very much so
 I'm not close to my family so my I don't really have one
 I have a Japanese friends I think the center came up I have a Japanese friend I'm very close but she's like my kind of my mother and
 I just met him socially
 I don't know nothing comes to mind
 yeah I think the sensor came off
 Ohio
 okay okay
 easy cuz I keep a regular schedule
 I'm just kind of tired maybe a little bit irritable
 a good
 well I'm recovering from PTSD so I sometimes feel that the PTSD and then I'll take a medication for that
 no it's just that it's just left over if that I'm still of the stress from it I'm still being treated for it but they don't really have any
 imma try not to talk about it
 I'm in the past but it's treated
 5 years ago
 I was I was just very sad very depressed and so that's why things iety so I went to the doctor and they helped me that I did a psychotherapy
 the app for the PTSD.
 I don't know I guess so
 it's just I'm just kind of supportive because of the issues I have with my family it's it supportive to have a doctor who is supportive and
 yeah it just gets me good feedback and helps me to make a decision that sort of thing
 yeah I have nightmares about my family sometime
 nah
 I just try to sleep better I should I hide it before I go to sleep I sort of like meditate a little bit to get to be calm and then hope that that will help
 I do have you all the time pretty much like I am a dog's make me happy and you know my life is really happy
 I guess you know it's a nice person thoughtful a good friend
 and happy fun person
 I don't remember my forties now so I'm pretty happy with myself I don't mind
 you know I've done a lot of work on myself and in therapy and stuff so I'm pretty
 I wouldn't really change a lot I'm pretty happy with myself and I'm about to sound conceited but I'm I'm pretty happy with myself now
 oh that was that would be on my parents they're very abusive so I that I don't talk to them anymore so you know any times with them you know that they did Terrible Things today so I prefer not to talk about it
 I like to see
 well I just started reading a book I like to read cookbooks and I was just reading a book called on when French women cook and it's about a woman's relationship with different women in France in different parts of France in the end the cooking and so I'm really enjoying that book
 I usually you know I'm get the grocery shopping done which I enjoy I really I really like doing the grocery shopping I go to a few places and then do a bit of cleaning and dime
 just I relax
 oh yeah I would I would say to have better self-esteem cuz I just have very low self-esteem you know from being abused and so tonight I wish I'd been happier in the past and you know taking me a long time to become unhappy because dinner no matter what it what I did whatever she meant I was I was never happy in the past I was I was always in a struggling with being depressed I didn't even know why and now and I realized because of whatever then set it that it was from my parents that I'm a relationship and so my advice would be to not have a relationship that is bad for you like sometimes estrangement is the best place in abusive relationship
 I'm just the way I live my life the way I treat people I think you know
 and I I believe it that your Deeds are very important that I try to treat people in a good way and I'm proud of my work and I've made that that'll give me a job that I like a lot of flexibility and I got to do what I like and
 and you know people like my work and then also making my dogs really tired of them and
 okay
 thank you bye

 yeah
 and then just do this
