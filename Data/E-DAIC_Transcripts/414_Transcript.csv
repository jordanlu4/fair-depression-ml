hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today
 created to talk to people in space
 and please
 are you okay with this
 yeah
 how are you doing today
 I'm okay
 Burbank California
 yeah
 the weather of course I think everyone likes the weather
 it's not too
 City like Chicago or New York it's a big enough we have beaches we're not landlocked
 sometimes the smog the traffic the fact that I've just been here like my entire life almost
 okay
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer
 do you travel a lot
 not enough as I'd like to I go to school in Chicago and I've been to New York a couple times San Francisco and I took a road trip across the country that was cool I saw a couple States
 what do you enjoy about traveling
 see new places
 going to Landmark that I've only
 read about ER theme pictures of
 I traveled from Los Angeles to Chicago taking Route 66 and the best part was seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time it was
 the coolest thing I've ever seen probably
 happy
 and then Happy was as beautiful it was nice
 I haven't felt like that in a long time
 I'm studying film
 it's just
 something I've always loved for as long as I could remember and when it came time to start applying to schools I wasn't sure what I wanted to do and I apply to Northwestern as a film student and it just ended up being the right decision
 dream job
 I love making movies but part of me really loves making people laugh and being in front of the camera so
 comedian I'm coming a comedic actor would be totally great but
 you consider yourself more shy or
 I am super outgoing and I love talking to people a lot I like I like being the center of attention usually
 hey
 but it's the best I've got
 I
 I like to watch mindless television like Toddlers & Tiaras and Duck Dynasty just TV programs were really don't have to pay attention at all
 okay
 how are you at controlling your temper
 I'm okay at it I get really emotional really fast but I am usually able to use to keep my anger down and not like lash out at others and stuff for the most part
 sometimes I get into like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily
 and I hate apologizing to people so besides could last pretty long
 my best friend Ryan I think
 and it was about
 our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and cross some lines and
 where how we were going to go back to the way it was before
 how hard is that
 really hard it's he's my best friend and I miss him
 but we messed up and this is just not the same
 it's like not the same friendship
 me too
 too many
 I guess
 when I have a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend because not okay I wish I would have just
 realize that this was bad and just would have stopped there and not have let it continue 4 weeks which led to my break up and then our friendship being really messed up
 I guess not spend as much time with him as I did
 be more assertive
 I guess
 it was
 in November
 I was very depressed and suicidal
 so I told my friend what I was feeling and that she needed to take me to the ER
 and from the ER I have the choice to
 I don't know I guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital
 and even though I felt like I didn't have a choice I knew it was my choice and I decided to go to the mental hospital which is like the worst experience of my life ever
 it was awful it was in Chicago and
 it was scary and I didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just
 start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices they were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and they were all really old and it was scary I didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were violent so that was pretty scary and I just dumb it was really hard for me
 I had been so depressed for like a month I stopped going to my classes and work and I told my teachers lies about being sick and I just kept calling in sick to work I dropped a class and I was failing my classes and not turned in any work and I wasn't talking to any of my friends and I was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and
 I was just in a really bad place and when I finally was going to kill myself I realized I needed help
 it was
 I had severe depression when I was a younger teenager and I tried to kill myself then and I got put in therapy for quite some time so I figured I don't want to go down that bad path again I just want to get better
 so I had to do it I had to get help
 I do I go once a week
 I feel like if you have the right therapist it's really useful
 I had one therapist that I really liked and I thought we could have gone really far but sadly she's back in Chicago and I'm in Los Angeles so I have to
 have to make do with this new therapist and she's okay
 just not we're not that great together but she's who I have right now
 better than nothing
 not that easy at all
 ever since I got out of the hospital and start a night began medication for my depression
 just haven't been able to sleep well falling asleep is hard staying asleep is hired have really crazy vivid dreams that wake me up in are disturbing
 like what
 I guess just
 sometimes they reflect things that I'm worried about are happening in my life but they're just
 the scary and they seem so real that sometimes I wake up and I have to ask my mom like did we go here to be do this to this really happen and it's usually know you dreamed that sometimes I've gotten so scared I like talk in my sleep and wake myself up
 probably like two nights ago
 wow
 tell me about the last time you felt really happy
 that is a
 hard question
 I think
 and November
 after I got out of the hospital
 I finally had one good day and my friend took me into downtown Chicago and we went to the Sears Tower and got to look over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city and that was with the cool
 how your best friend
 probably
 super outgoing likes to be the center of attention funny and a little bit crazy
 I try not to regret things in my life
 I would say that living is worth it and just don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it don't wait until it gets really bad
 I guess my ideal weekend would be sleeping in and then catching a movie with my friends may be going home with them and bake some cookies eat all the cookies watch some TV have a sleepover and then like make pancakes in the morning and watch more movies we watch a lot of movies I would like to do my free time
 go for a walk I don't know go to the beach
 that is a hard question I mean I think I've done a lot of great things in my life
 and I have achieved a lot but
 I think one of the proudest things badass moments in my life is something really small and insignificant I was doing this exercise boot camp and
 the last persons like cross the finish line had to do like
 30 pushups and it was some guy I didn't really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone want to help him if he's going to help them you have to do half each and no one wanted to help him and then I just decided to start doing push ups with him and I just
 it wasn't cuz I wanted to get creditor because I thought it would make me look good I just did it and no one really knows about that but it's just I feel really good about that
