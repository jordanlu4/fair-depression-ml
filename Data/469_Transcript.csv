 lately the change in weather it's kind of a little too unpredictable but it mainly the traffic and sometimes some rudeness of people
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world
 I want say a lot just occasionally
 it's nice to get a change of scenery and different things to do that maybe I wouldn't normally do different people learning about different people different customs
 depends I mean if it's the water real pretty water and you know being in beautiful water relaxing Adventure I love Adventure
 some time ago I went to Cayman Islands and
 went on I get seasick but my sister gave me some medication I went on a boat and we snorkeled and there were two boats and I accidentally got back on the wrong boat yeah and they're really crazy they made me jump back into the water and swim to the right boat and I thought I was going to drown because the water was kind of rough I was really shocked that they wanted me to do that
 yeah but I survived

 yes yeah but yes or no I mean now I kind of wish it was something different
 I like communication I love speaking and interviewing strangers I'm very outgoing and funny so probably would have been something more like either liberal arts communication that type of thing
 dream job which is be out there you know like some of these people may be on TV exploring different places and getting paid for it and always like a fun adventure interacting with people doing things I haven't done before and helping people you know on some way with what I do you could that they can see you know
 but I'm uncoordinated and in some ways and you know they could be uncoordinated and have some fun too
 I watch TV I go workout go walking I recently like a bike that I kind of sort of fixed up go do something new go to a festival go grocery shopping in Iraq with friends call them see them
 that type of thing
 talk to strangers
 depends on the situation there's a bunch of time so I'm good at it if it has to do with like traffic and cars it's a little more intense for me. Or people were like really rude you know with the way they cut you off
 almost
 luckily not you know I'm very assertive and maybe too much sometimes we're if somebody does something really rude to me in a parking lot I'll I'll confront them on that sometimes
 might have been with my sister
 I had to do with I'm not sure of the topic but whatever she was saying wasn't right and we got in an argument it sounds childish about who was right you know cuz she thinks she's always the smarter one cuz she's older
 sometimes it's frustrating cuz it's like it's a no-win situation she just wants to hammer on somebody till you know they acknowledged that she's right other times I just let it go and let her ride along cuz it's
 those kind of non productive
 I'm real close to I see my parents almost every weekend more close to my mother
 I have a twin sister I stay in touch with her even though she's out of town she lives out of town and I've got two other sister so I stay in touch with all of them you know it's a mixed bag you know

 but also
 well me and ever I mean stranger sometimes my family you know they've done nice things for me to strangers have been very sometimes unexpectedly very nice
 I could be shopping and you know maybe I can't reach something and some guy I'll pop up behind me and you know without me saying anything just help me out

 anti
 I had a situation years ago with a neighbor where he was really nasty to me cuz he thought I didn't like his dog was you know I'm not crazy about dogs but he kind of flipped out for a year-and-a-half and just said very nasty things to me when other people weren't around I wish I had confronted that back then because I yeah but it create a lot of anxiety for me cuz I feel like I could have nipped it in the bud and instead of having to deal with the
 major stress from it now he and I don't talk at all I just feel it's best it's kind of odd
 God there's been a lot
 sometimes breaking up with somebody or
 yeah Sushi or getting rid of a friend
 that type of thing
 sometimes I feel guilty about some of my past Behavior with people
 or maybe I wasn't his understanding
 when I was younger I stole things you know that's not the best behavior and
 kind of stuff like that

 that type of thing try and look for interesting activities to do to distract me
 will not officially but I know you know from things have experience that I've had you not get very anxious and certain situations
 yeah it's usually triggered by
 sometimes if somebody gets really angry and crazy it triggers a lot of anxiety in me if they're aggressive whether it be physically or verbally or sometimes if they're too much in my my space you know where I am if it bothers me
 yeah a long time ago
 ages ago

 I was depressed I mean it's nothing to laugh about but I mean it's kind of
 a circle just to want to be more positive and enjoy life more
 feeling stuck in certain thoughts I'm having a lot of negative thoughts feeling of hopelessness helplessness
 that type of thing
 I go occasionally it's a different type I'll go see a hypnotherapist sometimes to release anxiety that's in me
 yes I do very useful
 I want more awareness of myself and other people
 learning more control more confidence better self-esteem willing to try even more things you know whether I know the outcome or not you know of the unknown I'll experiment a lot more
 helping like at the 25th mile heading out water and there are some people there who are doing that for the first time also
 some event at my sister's where they were just a couple of us and I was cracking a lot of jokes sometimes I'm like really funny you know and I can't even believe myself and I just go on and you know that one starts laughing I'm not even trying to and I'm just saying like regular stories and people look at me funny laugh yeah

 supportive I'm hoping
 outgoing quirky type of person
 look be great to look even younger or be younger
 if that was humanly possible
 be even more patient with people I think you know not get frustrated like if I think somebody is not very smart sometimes it's real frustrating for me to be around some types of people
 well
