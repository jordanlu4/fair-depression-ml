sure
good I guess
 New Orleans Louisiana
 a 2005
 I used to go back often but not much anymore
 just think happened
 well I guess you're not programmed with Trina happened in 2005
 not really
 tell me about that
 where to begin just has different culturally have a different culture out here it's just a different place
 it's it's bike-friendly
 Louisiana isn't New Orleans for that matter really isn't now they're trying to be but it just it isn't that successful
 the drivers the crazy
 not really kind of but not much anymore
 don't have the money kind of broke
 just being able to go on an adventure
 I once went to Comic-Con on a on a bicycle like on a 3-wheel bike
 and that was pretty fun kind of scary and dangerous new I got killed it was scary
 traveling or just in general
 I got to say
 I got to say we were we were heading out of
 we were getting off the PCH and going into
 Laguna I'm going to have this really steep hill and on Sundays it's full of traffic
 and I remember going down
 that the hill and my brakes weren't working and I was trying to hit my brakes and try and hit my brakes and they just they wouldn't quick and I was like oh God and I'm going to throw you all bikes on larger than most bikes and I'm like zipping in between like gridlock traffic going downhill
 unable to break
 and I'm going down
 and suddenly there's the car that veers right into the century where I'm trying to go so I turn sharply
 in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic through oncoming traffic
 looping back through oncoming traffic back into the right traffic still without any breaks and like not managing to keep my bike from
 rolling which is painful when your bike rolls kind of hurts a lot
 so yeah
 noted
 various different things at Anthropologie visual effects
 kind of weird but yeah
 I've always had a fascination with film and
 I think the white people do things and go about things as fascinating
 just as like that the mob mentality of people
 especially
 dream job
 huh I have no idea
 did the job I guess
 I consider myself more outgoing
 you know I've never been afraid of what people think of me
 why people don't like people I don't know
 I'm not I'm not afraid of what they think
 I'm more concerned with like the people I know and what they think of me I guess so being outgoing just doesn't really affect me
 play video games listen to music
 yeah read books I like reading books and drawing reading books drawing playing video games
 did I forget anything sleeping
 I like sleeping that's fine
 not good
 and high school a I shove somebody's head through a locker
 yeah
 yeah that that's not good don't ever shut someone's head into a locker that's a great way to get suspended
 I don't know
 things like that just getting into fights
 like a serious argument
 I guess like
 argument over
 over
 I guess over like a like viewpoints on like that control and gun control laws
 I mean
 I was like yesterday evening
 it was
 it was an argument about you know gun control regulation I mean it doesn't really affect me personally but that was like the last argument I got into I want you specified I think
 my entire life
 I have
 about two years ago I broke up with like as everyone calls her my evil Acts
 and
 yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad I mean
 I think I've calmed down a lot since then
 what is a person as a whole but I mean I was angry and stuff I think I like one riding my bike for like a hundred plus miles in a senior day and I was in a ton of pain like later in the evening I got home I was like oh God like I can barely walk
 and yeah I think running off in like going on like extreme cycling spree was not good but is better than like
 eating too much in like just over eating cuz I was depressed but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like I wasn't physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death
 I don't think I've had a singular hard decision I've ever had to make because
 my my biggest thing
 and why don't you know don't regret
 don't regret the things you do
 just regret the opportunities you've messed and that's like had to come with me that's like hats I've had to like learn that in the past like 2 years
 like two years ago I totally just cannot grasp that concept and answer your question I think thinking about it the hardest decision I've had to make is
 I'd say
 probably
 probably to break up with my ex probably
 where do I begin
 my ex was not a good person and just in any way shape or form of the word
 she did some things they wasn't entirely comfortable with
 just took that the people around her and to me
 I
 you know they say You're supposed to give forgive people
 for making mistakes or doing things
 and I just I think there's some things you can't forgive people for no matter how hard you try and I think there's something that wants done
 but they can't be undone they just their through the way that they are
 and I think I think after what she did
 I like I just did things just fell apart after that it just to spite us trying
 I just didn't work out I mean
 I don't know I don't really want to talk about exactly what happened
 emojis
 oh man
 erase for my memory or just erased from ever happening
 huh I don't you know that's hard
 Katrina just the experience of Katrina for starters
 my ex I guess between those two it's it's going to hurt at that actually rather lean towards Katrina cuz that was just that that was not
 I mean I guess you don't exactly know about it but
 in 2005
 does giant storm hit
 New Orleans Louisiana killed a whole bunch of people level the town
 and I'm also at a friend's during the storm
 I mean I'm kind of getting over it but it's still it's still there and I think
 I don't know I mean
 you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive in that but there's just there's nothing the only thing you can do is just think that was like a freak accident will never happen again I live in LA and you know
 earthquakes can happen I just think I'd rather rather know that it's coming then not know it's coming
 have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD
 yes
 yeah
 depression it's record multiple times
 that's no surprise first time I was diagnosed was in Middle School
 which would have been
 ten well ten between 10-12 years ago I don't know I don't know whenever I was in the sixth grade that's my first was told that I was depressed
 as far as PTSD goes
 post-katrina
 and then you know
 post-katrina moster that was the big thing
 I guess having been diagnosed previously is being depressed and still being in high school
 it kind of wasn't I wasn't really seeking help its kind of I got that kind of got into my high school and then we're like here's help cuz we know you're going to need it
 and I was like oh well thanks I didn't really ask for it but okay I'll take it
 you know
 just kind of happened
 no not not anymore
 what's a good question you know I was like I'm not going to do this anymore
 sometimes
 sometimes it's a lot of like how are you feeling today and stuff and
 you know it's kind of well I'm feeling fine right now but
 ask me in 2 hours and who knows you know
 I guess
 it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happened just happened and to just get on and move along with your life
 essential just like carrion you know things will happen carry on
 tell me about the last time you felt really happy
 wow
 I was
 I was hanging out with my girlfriend just hanging out
 for starters I mean you can't see when I walked in but I'm walking with cane right now cuz I got hit by a car recently and make my leg better
 what's a chainsaw over there that way but anyway
 I don't know I make myself less fat
 how to make it so I don't feel the incessant need to sleep 14 hours a day
 ohm kiss when you sleep like more than 10 hours a day it's just some productive if you waste too much time with guy friends who are like oh you know I feel rejuvenated after 6 hours and I'm like how do you do that I have to sleep with 12 hours to feel good when you can sleep 6 you know like in an crunch time you know you can get away with for I have to get away with seven or eight you know
 like that that's my crunch time sleep schedule 8 hours it's just I don't know I oversleep but I like sleeping to
 I'm just the oversleeping part I don't like so much
 utterly insane in a good way I'd really insane in a good way I guess
 like that they would also say like you know
 that there are times where I might seem like an asshole and I'm not really an ass-whole I just you know
 I just have issues like everybody else specifically I have Asperger's so that's a form of autism
 I'm not just kind of makes life awesome
 did also say I'm flamboyant an eccentric cuz I totally am
 I just
 I don't know I figure I'm still alive so I should live because I'm still alive
 do you know who knows how long I'm going to be live for so I should you know
 Live While I'm Alive and just
 go out and do stuff not
 not sit and be calm
 except when I'm reading
 I like reading
 stop fucking up know it's kind of messed up
 I think I would have told myself at the time
 because I have known my my evil acts I've known her since like I was like six and she was five I think 10 years ago I would have grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl
 don't trust her she can't be trusted and more importantly don't
 don't let your guard down around her cuz show show exploit that
 I don't mean like physically let your guard down not mentally
 yeah don't date or just don't do it it's not worth it it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain
 it's not worth it
 the fact that I'm still alive Maybe
 yeah I don't know cycling the Comic-Con I was pretty proud of that pretty proud that I managed to do it
 just
 I don't you know I don't really know I don't really use the term pride and I really feel Pride
 I'm just it's more like the fact that I'm still alive I'm proud to be alive
 I don't know if that makes me humble or just insane
 who knows
 do I press the button now I'll buy
 okay
 to who do do do do do
 by the way her eyes are really creepy
 just saying that
 it's just the way that they say that they have the uncanny
