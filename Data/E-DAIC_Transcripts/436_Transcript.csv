that was big
 yes
 I'm doing fine
 Mexico
 when I was young seven years song
 I've been there like that three or four times for vacation
 well it's a less stressful I don't know if it's because I'm on vacation but I feel more at peace over there than here
 well my family moved down here for a better life that was my parents
 just the weather and different things that you could do you could be at the beach or you could go to the mountains different variety of things to do
 the traffic and some basically the traffic and that's one of the main things
 nothing much I've been to New York and Mexico only
 I just seen you places and finding new locations you know something new
 like for a trip over
 I've been to Mexico I've been to the pyramids of I forgot to call in Mexico City and I like to know about finding a lot of my Asian culture since I'm Mexican from Mayan Aztecs I like to see different things like that
 well that's cool why did drop out but I came back and I'm trying to get back into it right now trying to learn graphic designs
 well I started liking you know to take pictures doing different things and I like you know going into business I like what the titles about
 I want to have my own business either making web pages just be able to be free and don't be in relying on someone else just be able to have freedom for myself
 how's it going
 Spectre you know be around people like to get to know people and depending on the person how I feel around them
 I'd like to hear music or you know it was a different thing that case boards or two different things just to unwind
 well I'm getting better at it you know
 Hyatt connect
 I was like
 2 days ago I was something about that I needed to pay bills on something that I did not have taken care of but the person he's like more picky about it and I was more know how gross are you know that they want everything right there and then
 I have a handle you know I have everything there and they just bugging sometimes they don't give you the space that you need to erase all something
 I felt like I was overwhelmed already had it resolved I just was waiting for a check you know it's not on my control but I already had made the paper proper arrangements and she's bugging me about it it's like
 you're making an argument and storm in the glass of water
 the different need thirst couple of them but not so recently because I've been more trying to get my life together but since I made before in the past I dropping out of school and do another different thanks
 guilting not that much because
 not really not that I can think right up top of my head
 the hardest decision
 I was just on top of my head right now
 the band
 the only things that I remember is when I black out or different things like that that I remember
 nothing like a particular only with my brothers died and different things like that
 how my brother was in gangs and different things and he was getting more to trouble
 and it's just not a pleasant memory for me to talk about that much get into it
 don't understand it. You know I like to be with my family and you know I like to go over there to Mexico to I have a half-sister and my grandpa died he was older Mexico so I do I like to have a good relationship with my family
 my mom and dad they always work hard they always done what they have to do to pay the bills that's why sometimes I be like you no running around trying to get everything done but done correctly not trying to take the easy way out
 it's a little hard because they're especially here in Los Angeles there's a lot of different things that you can get into that's not that positive and it's hard to stay focused on you know the correct stuff
 Well normally I just knock out it's not that hard it's like to take me like half an hour or 15 minutes but sometimes I can even wake up even with the alarm they have to wake me up in know my grass wake me up in with the alarm going on it's like so hard Cena I just knock out
 I do get a little either I'm angry or I don't feel good and then I'll feel bad energy but I still have to know I know I have to do something so I still go through with it
 I've been swept in the feeling good do you know then that little restless but not that much I have to do stuff so I guess you know for myself to do it no matter how I feel
 nothing out of the ordinary
 no
 the last time iPhone happy that was following the weekend that I would see not going out with a cloud have some fun and they know I was drinking and just relaxing I want winding down
 ideal weekend is usually with my girl either out or at home just relax when nothing else you know just be able to relax and unwind with her you know you were going out somewhere tonight place we're staying at home that without getting any calls or in the interruption might just be able to turn off the phone and turn off everything just be what are doing the other different things
 like an outgoing guy in a very social but at the same time I'm reserved depending how I feel with people
 at the cross her feel comfortable with them
 well I'm changing a lot of my temper and different things drinking things on changing the different things I could get more different things done
 there's several but mostly is when I'm coming from Mexico that they wanted the meaner you even down there I feel like silly because I went to a store I was regularly dressed and I was the time I wanted to buy something and then they said that that I wasn't belong there and I ended soon as they saw my credit card they kind of change perspective because I saw the Wells Fargo logo they know it's American but they thought it was let you know
 what is told me it's all ridiculous to me because you go to a place you know you have the money ask for something you can ask for something because you have it and not just the way to kill the time just because they saw a logo of a card that's how that you know it was ridiculous for me
 no
 basically to stay more focused on different things that stay in school and then I don't go to not try to control my temper and do different things cuz if I knew what I know now back then he'll be different
 well I did drop out but I did go back to school and I know I did get my high school and right now I'm deposit to another different thing so right now is getting my high school getting back together right now I'm working to another girl I'm trying to get me know either going back to school so the basic basically getting back to school and finishing the high school for GED
 awkward like I thought it would
