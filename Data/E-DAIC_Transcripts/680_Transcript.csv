 shy
 tell me about
 family
 oh wow
 I came from a dysfunctional family I really don't have many Family Values
 me and my brother 13 years apart in age so I really don't know my brother that well
 so I really don't know much of a family life we never sat down at the table together and had meals together it was always like separate times when we come in and eat another one would come in and eat we never sat down at the same table
 so I don't know much about family life
 I listen to music
 and
 I listen to relaxing relaxation music like Chimes a brook water running stuff like that
 how are you
 I'm on medication right now I get aggravated really easily mood swings personality disorder but sometimes it just flares up depending on the situation of somebody gets in my face but I try not to let it happen cuz I know the circumstances
 when was the last time you argue with them
 Wheels on the Bus
 I was sitting in the back on the bus and the guy came back and he wanted me to move for he could sit down but I'm a big guy and he's a big guy so I decided just to get up and let him have a seat I didn't want to get no confrontation I just let it go
 that had to be meeting a girl that I've known for 18 years
 she's had two children with this guy and
 now the guys going to be part of the family and I feel very comfortable about that
 but I still have feelings for this girl but I know that the father of the boys but not married he's going to be involved with the family and I I don't like that
 what's something you feel guilty about
 that's a good one back in 2010 I went back from my mom's funeral and my brother was hard up for money
 and he took his Ira out and spend it and I have promised him I was going to pay him back I wasn't able to pay him back and he held it against me so I felt guilty about that because I made a promise and I didn't keep it but there was more circumstances into that and he doesn't understand he didn't write to me he didn't call me he didn't do a lot of things
 tell me about the hardest decision
 the hardest decision I ever had to make
 was when I was with the merchant marines I was very comfortable being at sea
 and my wife at the time she wanted me to stop sailing and just get a regular nine-to-five job where I would have been very comfortable staying at Sea and working on ships cuz I love that that was what I loved but she didn't like that so she'd rather me work 9 to 5
 tell me about new bed or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
 dead bodies I always see a lot of dead bodies
 I had circumstances in the military where I recovered a dead body in the Philippines a boy had jumped ship and we recovered the body underneath the pier and I had to pull the body out and put it in a body bag and another incident was in boot camp
 there was a circumstances were me and this guy got letters all the time from our girls but he was engaged and he committed suicide because
 the girl dumped him for another guy and a crush them and he end up jumping 3 ft in front of me while I was in Barracks Duty and I seen his head explode like pumpkin and it affected me greatly I see that all the time
 have you ever served in the middle
 yes I was in the Navy 15 years
 into with the merchant marines
 24
 family thing my father was in the Navy my cousin's was in the Air Force my other uncle was in Marine Corps I just wanted to serve my country
 are you happy you did that yes
 I love my country USA serve in the military
 no ragrets
 I know but we escorted Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf
 we
 had the weapons pointing at us while we escorted Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf but I never saw combat was never in the combat situation never had a fire a gun at somebody so I don't know what it was like
 what I'm traveling through is going through is non combat PTSD which means I was in a combat zone
 at first it was hard I was collecting unemployment for 18 months then after the unemployment ran out I had to get a job so I got various jobs working security and refineries and I tried to stay busy the best I could
 it was okay
 I worked refineries I worked security I worked for wineries security guard for wineries I did a little odds and ends
 I was able to get a full-time job
 and that was with the merchant marines I went to the Coast Guard and
 apply for
 set g m e d I forgot but anyway I worked for engineering
 how did serving in the military change you
 made me a better person
 I was in a scared when I first joined I was kind of scared but then we join the military and made me a lot tougher and stronger I stood up for my own grounds I wasn't being pushed around
 and
 I just like people applauding when you would walk into a place and they would appreciate what you did for your country
 made it all worthwhile
 depressed
 mood swings
 high anxiety
 isolation
 I have no social life
 I don't have much of a communication with women I don't know how to act around them
 so I'd like to say to myself
 have you noticed any changes
