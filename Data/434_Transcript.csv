yes I am
 I'm doing very good today
 I'm originally from Chicago Illinois moved out here when I was three
 yes
 I never go back
 family issues
 it depends on what you're into if you're into
 the fast life and Hollywood it doesn't compare at all if you're into the cold weather than you would rather be out there I like the sun
 my mom and my dad split up
 it's okay
 I have no idea I was only three when I moved out here
 I like the sunshine I like the weather I like the balance of the weather we have in the spring winter
 fall and end in the summer I like the beaches I like Hollywood I like that the Lakers are here and I love the people is is a different variety I think La is a microcosm of the United States people from all over the world come to the United States and people from all over the country and all over the world they come to La for a better opportunity so that's why I like about la
 no gang violence
 no not really I travel one time to Arizona and one time the Stockton California and another time to Barstow California but I don't do much traveling right now because of finances
 study alcohol and drug counseling
 I just filled it in my I just got into my heart that that's who I was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addiction so
 that was kind of easy choice I got some advice from people and I just went into it to do it just just to see what it was and finish school
 it internship and got hired and so
 I believe that's what I'm supposed to be doing with my life
 I'm not working right now I actually moved away and
 I had to
 I was married and we had to move away we moved away because rent was cheaper so I actually had to give up that job in order to make that move but since I came back down I've been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interview so I can get back into counseling
 well
 it can be it can be very difficult at times because
 I have a felony and and so I can't work with you and I can work with the elderly and but the regular dose I can and then you have to be certified and I'm not certified yet you have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified before they even like you to take the test you after work a certain amount of hours so right now I'm just trying to get into interns you know try to intern and show people what I can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen them my resume and
 yeah they just want people to be certified not being certified the experience and the fact that I have a felony makes it hard
 and my dream job is to open my own facility
 or as an author
 you know that the that depends on on on people mainly I mainly adapt my personality to the people that I'm around if people are perky that I'm going to be perky if they're standoffish then I may seem shy but I'm not sure I'm just giving them their space and allowing them to decide when they want to open up but if people open up right away then I open up right away
 I mean listen to music or
 I watch YouTube write poetry
 I'll just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like I could sing which I can't so that's
 and nothing I do is I eat ice cream
 controlling my temper I'm very very good at it it depends on what it is I have to say that last time I lost my temper because I felt like somebody was
 scaring my mother so I lost my temper but ninety-nine times out of hundred
 I don't lose my temper don't like to raise my voice and I just like to be calm and cool and I like everybody to be comfortable I don't want anybody be frightened or anything there's no reason for anybody be frightened and for us to be angry and you know taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it I just believe that and I believe angry outbursts to be a link to
 heart problems and high blood pressure so I definitely don't want that
 well I was just telling you about it was it was my mother's husband and
 tell you the truth I could have handled that differently but when I seen the look in my momma's eyes of fear I just lost it and I snapped you know I told my mother like I don't like this you need to take care of this because I'm don't know how long I can keep my composure as far as this cuz I've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but that's her husband and so I kept my distance in a relationship but when I saw her having fear in her eyes that triggered a part of me
 dad
 I don't like very much because I know if I get angry I usually stay angry for a long time so I should have just left
 I should have just left and went home and rested and got up the next morning with the church but yeah we had a big Time Explosion and they had created and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months so yeah those 6 9 months I can't get back
 yes
 well my brother in prison I haven't seen him in 20 years he's been there 20 years my sister move to Chicago
 13 years ago I haven't seen her since then so I'm only close to my mother and my son I haven't seen him in 5 years and I'm still looking for him and waiting for the day I see him again and how that's going to turn out for me I just you know I have small family and
 I have family in Chicago but
 I don't mess around with that side of the family just just because of what I seen and heard so I just don't want it to happen to me at all so I just keep my distance
 has been a positive influence in my life I would say
 taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me expressing my emotions being threatening to someone else and talked taught me how how to like monitor my emotions in monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and when they're really strong that's when I just need to be quiet until that intense spelling subsides and then I can speak rationally and not just emotionally and of course he's he was the one that told me that I should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor he's got 27 years clean and sober right now he used to live on skid row and the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something that I'll never forget
 feel guilty about my grandfather
 pass away in 2004
 and at that time I was just getting out of prison
 2002 I was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he
 told me in so many words that he wasn't going to be around for that much longer but I didn't get it cuz I had a lot of drugs and alcohol my life at the time and my life is crowded with things that I consider to be more important than that plus the fact I didn't understand him what he was saying but
 when he died
 I figured out that he was telling me that I should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go but I couldn't see it then and
 I feel
 I think about it all the time
 erased from my memory
 will be the date
 my brother hit my mom I always Replay that over and over and over and over in my mind and it's like
 that's what Memories I can just go without replaying my mind over and over and over and over and over again so yeah that day that memory right there
 I feel conflicting feelings
 because I want hand
 on way hey my brother was protecting me
 from getting beat
 and on the other hand he was his my mom
 so
 time in the middle
 most nights I don't know
 I go to sleep maybe 3 in the morning and I'm proud I'm more than likely up at 7 in the morning so I don't get much sleep
 it depends it depends on the environment I mean if I don't sleep well
 I'm going eventually I'm going to be here to boo but doesn't happen right away it depends on my environment and who's around me if they're difficult people that's going to be a challenge for me and if people are easy going and no one would even know that I didn't get much sleep
 I've been feeling lately I just been feeling like
 Dad
 things are about to start going better for me maybe some better decisions taken advantage of the opportunities that come to me taking advantage of my talents taking advantage of meeting the right people that can open the right doors for me so I'm very enthusiastic about that even if it doesn't happen I'll send out a million resumes I don't care if I get 5 interviews I've I've never stopped because I know know that been a counselor is my life mission and and I'm also destined to be a writer and it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people know about me because I found a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and I have a lot to offer Humanity so it's just a matter of time before
 that the public is exposed to what I've been Gathering
 my behavior I'm more mellow I laughed more more humorous
 I let a lot of things go that I used to just
 let take me off and anger me and things that I can't control like trying to control people or or or trying to make sure people don't betray me and you just can't control that I think I matured mentally and psychologically and and the acquisition of a sense of humor was a major major breakthrough for me so
 I know my thoughts of change and with my thoughts changing my behavior has changed I still have to monitor it my thoughts and my behavior I still have to monitor them but overall you know
 back then I just tolerating myself now I
 actually like myself and it will boo boo hoo you to feel the same way
 no no I haven't
 no
 last time I feel happy was last night cuz the Lakers won the basketball game
 my best friend was described me he calls me the truth
 because I always tell the truth and people tried to hide stuff and I always refill it they can't hide it from me I have a statement that says I see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it and I see stuff days and months before they start happening I no human behavior when I see it and I sniff it out real well and it's just a gift that was given to me so he calls me the truth because of how I interact with people and how people have to come clean with me because when they look at me they know that I see through them like I said like a clear glass with nothing in it and yes that's why he calls me the truth
 I wish I would have never
 well obviously I wish I would have never went to prison
 I wish
 Falcon change well
 my economic status my employment status
 my teeth that's like a problem area for me I did a lot of stupid things years ago and it caught up with me and I didn't take care of my teeth and now that I need to be
 confident about myself as I can be you know it always comes up every now and then you know the thought like I wonder if they look when they're to look in that might if I never get the I never get the impression that they are but in the back of my mind there she starts that says
 are they looking at my teeth so I will really change that and I will change my physical size I think I would like to be at least 35 pounds heavier but I'm working on it
 20 years ago which would make me 18
 I would have at that time I was a big-time high school basketball player for Fremont High School and I had college is coming to see me and I would have given myself the opportunity was the to stay away from the troublemakers because I didn't and I blew my opportunity to play college basketball for Duke Blue Devils and who knows I could have been playing for the Lakers last night but hey
 I'm most proud of the fact that
 you know what I'm most proud of my mom
 really
 really she graduated from school
 she got a full-time job she got a full-time job she would wake up at
 5 in the morning go to work get off her job at 3:30 go straight to the college lead to college at 9 at night she does this 5 days a week and still had the strength to maintain of she was on the Dean's List and President's List so doing all of this you know when they say that older people can do things I just think that's dispels that rumor
 and she recently got her license as a evangelist in the church so I'm just real proud of that and
 her life is been affecting people in a positive way so yeah Mama
 okay thank you
 goodbye
 okay
 oh did you know that she stopped
 oh okay okay
