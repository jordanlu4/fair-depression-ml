 well like I said I grew up here as a child
 I like the people for the most
 smog too much traffic
 sometimes you feel like you're amazed cuz it La just keeps growing and growing and growing in the space is getting smaller and smaller and smaller
 other than that though I don't have any problems with the Los Angeles I like the fish I'm right here by the coast so that's never a problem
 that's my way of relieving stress I like to go fishing
 you travel a lot no I pretty I'm pretty much a homebody I pretty much stay in the area I used to travel a lot
 but I've gotten older I've become more of a I wouldn't say couch potato but I like to stick close to home
 meeting people
 thing thing for finding new places new restaurants new museums
 well I used to when I get a 3-day weekend when I was younger I would just jump on my car throw my fishing tackle in the trunk and just take off I need to go from here to San Diego from here to the Oregon or whatever on a three-day weekend wouldn't tell anybody where I was I come back and everybody would be freaked out but I used to do just to get away from everything
 play some eat a lot of interesting people
 the trip I took the San Diego one time when I stayed at
 what's the island over there where the Navy Seals train there's a big hotel over there and was in the middle of the week and was like I was the only one there on the beach really Pleasant

 you consider yourself more shy or outgoing I can go both ways on that
 sometimes I'm I'm standoffish shy but for the most part I'm not going
 well I guess this is just the way I am I guess

 by the way we've been keeping in contact
 oh I like to go fishing I like to watch a good movie
 an entertaining movie hello the guys where I live I like to watch like TruTV cops things like that because you face it every day
 out on the street or on the bus or driving wherever
 or wherever you might go in any anywhere now but pretty much just relax
 being able to focus on something it'll take your mind off other things that might you might be having a problem with her might be stressing you out that work for instance
 how are you
 very efficient I like to think things through before I
 I get angry at anyting
 and
 it's not that I get angry at I don't get angry at idiosyncrasies that type of situation or people's habits or anything it's
 I got angry at a lot of society I see things popping popping up popping up in society that seem to be going towards the out-of-control direction is opposed to the getting things under control and
 but now I'm pretty good at managing my anger in my
 how would you say my reaction reactions
 two different situations
 let me think something I can't really think of anything significant
 tell me about a situation that you wish you were
 okay
 give you an incident
 a couple weeks ago
 no being a hoe something I feel guilty about
 picked up my mother was spent the last four years of her life and a sub Acute Care Center here at to Little Company of Mary from diabetes and stroke to pick my dad up
 every morning drop him off in an hour or so with my mother and then go on to work and then after work I pick him up and come to drop him off and then I'd go back all the night she passed away
 I picked him up and dropped him off and then I had to go home for a little while and I was going to go back that night and I fell asleep on the couch
 I like lean I know it's like
 the hardest decision
 all right back to think about that
 that situation that I just explained about the night my mother passed away at falling asleep and when I got back up that this morning to go pick up my daddy said your mother passed away last night
 what made it really difficult and she was by her Capel mental capabilities were were completely there she or cognitive awareness everything she knew what was going on but her body just gave out
 and nobody
 yes I was in United States Coast Guard for 6 years
 I spent four years at coast guard air rescue
 and my last 18 months was right here in
 Chronicles
 when it was here I think it's in Florida now
 is actually pretty good Duty I made rate really quick I just spent a couple days in the brig here and there but I got out with my fully five status
 that's one of the big that's really the only true regret I have is I should have stayed in and and been retired by now
 17
 I had to
 well I'll my grandfather pulled some strings and got me an appointment
 for a needle Academy and but my physical exam worse me out of that my exam because of bad depth perception and it kind of wanted me to come in just as the general duty officer but I wanted to be a pilot that's a No-No No-No and I backed out of the whole thing and your later
 I thought about it and go would like to still get drafted
 oh yes it was definitely a better choice that put me through my school my education and Ladder years
 taught me quite a bit of discipline
 levels of self-esteem
 did you ever speak
 not as such we arrested a few people on drug bust in that type of thing back in the 70s
 but not combat for saying not not armed combat
 most of it
 it was great cuz the last like I said the last 18 months was right here in
 and I live
 Los Angeles Los Angeles County so it was basically a 9 to 5 job to me
 so I had no problem going back in the transition anyway what were the six years that I was in the service I saved a lot of money u.s. savings bonds of course so I saved enough money to be able to relax for a couple years to decide what I really wanted to do and that's when I decided to go back to college get a couple degrees saying manufacturing mechanical engineering quality engineering and I've been doing that
 79
 it's been pretty productive productive
 I pride myself and the knowledge and experience I picked up over the years
 to do after the military
 machinist machinist engineering
 quality control quality assurance
 it's been
 quite a lot it made me realize I had a future instead of just when I was younger you know just kicking around thinking you were going to live forever and not really focusing on anything for the future
 you got the military has been a very good benefits touch with the GI bills
 back then like I said it paid for your education so I had that option and I took that option
 you're sorry to hear that but I took the option to use the GI bill for my education
 fire during their I'm going through some side effects with my new inhalers I have a COPD bronchitis chronic bronchitis and they've been giving me some dizzy spells and coughing spells in the morning when I get up and have to take these inhalers and it really it exhaust you it takes a lot out of you
 but I'm getting up there and unfortunately I'm still smoking on the lighter side of that I'm not as smoking as much as I used to
 but other than that I'm doing pretty good I'll be moving out of US Vets in a couple of months and I need to pick up with the pace on that to find an apartment
 have you noticed any change
 no I'm still focused it before work focused on getting into a permanent residence
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 usually it's usually it's pretty easy I have those times when I'm tired to the point of where it's hard to fall asleep and sometimes I can just go to sleep right away
 how long does thinking of maybe something that happened during the day like you mentioned earlier in this conversation things I could have handled better things I could have done a little differently
 what are you like
 Trump fired
 little grouchy I guess a little grouchy but a cup of coffee and I'm usually through it and over it
 no
 back before I go to the service I was diagnosed with what do they call it bipolarism
 but I never really thought much about it
 did you know you get up when you get down
 last Saturday when I went to go deep sea fishing
 got a really nice red snapper that was about that be
 where was what With Friends
 my grandfather
 Oasis spend a lot of time with him on summer vacations when I was a teenager
 my dad was in his retired army so he was away so I guess my grandfather was more of my my father's been the male figure in my in my life
 he passed away 1972 no 1970
 21 * 2 * 3 * 72 and was 1972
 best friend
 easy going
 fishing
 what are you most proud of
 my children
 I have three kids three children $2 to $2 one son I'm really proud of my oldest daughter I was able back in 1986 I came into a significant amount of money to be able to put them all through college if they wanted and my oldest daughter took me up on it
 she graduated
 she's doing her internship there is a doctorate in biology
 I think I've asked
 thanks for sharing your thoughts with me you're very welcome I feel like I'm in an episode of The Matrix
 you need some pictures on the back
 goodbye
 you know the first thing I thought of when I said I didn't realize she was sitting there in that chair was The Matrix
