where's my little button are you bringing okay all right
 yeah she looks like human
 okay
 okay alright okay you're welcome
 are you okay with this yes
 today is a wonderful day I'm doing just absolutely marvelous
 I was born in Cleveland Ohio I was raised in Tucson Arizona and came to Los Angeles when I was 16 years old
 yes
 I've only been back once since I left
 Soho another Community when I was going up I'm so glad I grew up there because it was a great sense of community which I think we don't have here in Los Angeles
 my grandmother died and left property for my father so we came here to manage her property property
 it was pretty easy for me I was still young and it was easier to adapt so I'm pretty good at meeting people that has never been a problem I travel a lot as a child so I was used to moving and going to new places
 meeting new people seeing new things it's an adventure and I like The Adventurous life
 oh one of my best troops I had it was in nineteen I'm dating myself but 1964 I came out here to visit my grandmother from Cleveland Ohio and I went to an Indian reservation and I got a little note card about the reservation when I got back home I wrote to the reservation and I told him I when I went back to school in September I would have to write deliver a speech rather about what I did over the summer and I told them I wanted to talk about going to the Indian reservation and what they send me something and they sent me this huge Cucina Indian down and that was that was a wonderful experience to have the thing is worth now if I still had it I found out like a quart of a million-dollar so
 but that's one of the best person
 I can be a little bit of both I'm pretty when I have to be I can be outgoing cuz I'm good at talking to people and meet people but sometimes I have a little bashful side-by-side me to the little bit of both
 I study business administration with a emphasis in marketing and advertising
 I'm really I started in computer science but that was back in the day when computer science wasn't is what it is today and I'd like I was good at it but it wasn't any interaction with people and I love people so I wanted something that would bring me interaction with people so I wouldn't a marketing and I was working for a TV station where I was going to school so that fit in line in marketing advertising so
 no now I'm a photographer I'm a celebrity photographer I shoot a lot of stars I shoot on the red carpet I shoot a lot of special events and anything of people will pay me for
 it's not hard at all this my passion I love it is like not working
 I'm in my dream job I just need to get more jobs that pay pay me well because there's a lot of times as photographer you have to do a lot of things event for free to get known so it's a building process of relationships I'm still in that process of building relationships so that I can get more pay jobs but this is my dream job I love what I do
 okay
" well now I'm really back into it I used to do it a while that I got away from it but this meditation I practice meditation I try to do it twice a day in the morning and at night before I go to sleep I work with Oprah and Deepak Chopra and anybody else who provides me with meditation and I use that too
 I can really control my temper sometimes I get set off I guess like any other human being but I work at trying to keep it moderate and temperate temperature and personality
 oh wow we argued with my daughter the other day about something I said and I did not mean to say it to hurt her but it obviously did and we argued about that what my intentions were my intentions were never to hurt her and maybe what I said did and that's what started sergeant
 oh God I felt terrible because I never intended to hurt my daughter and I never wanted to hurt her and I feel bad that she had been hurt by what I have said I had to have the guard my word to watch my thoughts
 but I don't have much of a relationship with my with my brothers and sisters and mother and father my parents live far away so it's just my two daughters here with me and we have a pretty good relationship you know we try to work my my daughters and makeup artist I'm a photographer so we work a lot together in the industry so sometimes I think we're up on each other to close we need a little more space
 yeah when I say the wrong things
 no is never easy to be a parent it's like working progress
 making the right decisions about things sometimes
 the love the show look feeling of accomplishment that you were able to raise the highest creation on this planet to be a wonderful and productive human being
 I'm not as strict as my parents where I give my kids a little more freedom to find out who they are I'm not real religious like they do but I am very spiritual so I brought them up different from me on the religious tip and more I listen more to them I think than what my parents did it was you were to be seen and not heard when I was growing up and I let my kids voice be here
 what's something you feel guilty about one night I had a bad night that changed my life and I don't want to go into details I feel bad about that night
 yeah I could have stayed home
 go out and trying to think about it and situation maybe those handling of how I me and my husband divorced I think I could have handled that a little differently
 well we we I think we really loved each other a lot and we just it was it was something that had come to an end and the way we separated was kind of explosive and I think both of us could have handled it better but I think I played a part in keeping a lot of drama going because I was hurt that we were breaking up and kind of devastated because I wanted my child to be raised for their father so I think Looking Back Now which is you know hindsight is 20/20 vision I could have handled things a little better but what can you do you do the best that you can at that time if you knew better you do better
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to
 the hardest decision I've ever had the hardest decision ever had to make was I was on my way to work as an enrollment counselor on the plane had a stroke was going to making a connection and to get on the other plane to and then go to the hospital and a doctor was sitting behind me and he told me that I could not get on that plane because I might have another stroke it was a hard decision cuz I was in Dallas Texas all by myself I did not I mean I was in there with the employee but I would be left all by myself cuz my employees have to go on to Montgomery Alabama where we were headed and I had to make a decision should I stay or should I go but my life was in the balance so I made the decision to stay and go to the hospital but that was a hard one
 overwhelmed I mean here I am on my way to work you know I flew to different state every week and they help kids get get admitted into college and here I am on my way to work and I'm on a plane and I feel this weird feeling coming over the left side of my body and I say my prayers when I go to sleep and then when I wake up to get off the plane I can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment which I did every week so I knew something was wrong it was it was when you see your life in the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's going to happen next so it was very disturbing very traumatic and you know you don't know what's happening to you is so the weirdest thing riding to the hospital in a medical ambulance that was a weird experience
 I'm sorry but I'm here you know I've survived is a doctor told me nobody survives it a stroke on a plane and I survived so Universe wasn't finished with me yet
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep you know it's that sometimes I have a little problem with it sleeping a little bit sometimes I I get wired up I get wired up just because I'm one of those real energetic persons and I have to finish what I set out to do and until I finished I can't go to sleep so sometimes it's hard for me to go to sleep by the time I can lay down and just go but depends on what's going on in my head
 what are you
 sluggish probably a little on edge but I try to keep a puppy personality I'm really energetic person so I try to but you know if your tired your body is still talking to you so
 lately I've been feeling really well except I've been having some problems because I have a since I had two stroke I have nerve damage in my head and in my face and so I just it's I thought it's been over a year since I had two stroke but I thought by now it would have gotten a little better and it has it but I'm so grateful to be alive that that is really my minor compared to the bigger picture and I wasn't fortunately my I didn't lose my facial structure or you know my face is not screwed up like a lot of people are I still can use my hands I still beat you with my camera but my left hand is is diminished and use but I can shoot with my right hand as a photographer so I can still keep doing my work
 so you know I have to keep a good upbeat
 energies going on for me to keep for me to be successful
 no but I went through depression from being knocked unconscious five times and I was a schoolteacher every ball there was that you could name soccer ball baseball basketball name that ball hit me in my head and I suffered from having like sleep apnea not been able to sleep from being hit so many times and knocked unconscious in the head
 no only I don't go to therapy because
 I don't I don't have any medical right now so I'm not able to get therapy they only offered that to people with medical hard to get it and I'm not work yet sucks I'm not working right now because I'm still trying to get my disability so that I can get well cuz I'm going to be a fulfilled human being and I want to be totally and you know the system it'll be almost two years before I go for a hearing
 so that's kind of depressing to think after all the years I've been working since I was 16 and it's taking me it's been over a year or the year I had two stroke February 2012 and we are now in March of 2013 and I won't have a hearing until September 2013 just to tell me if I get the disability or not that's been very depressing for me because I'm wondering where I lived off my savings in the last year and I got put my daughter through college you finished and now she's having to take care of me and she still looking for a job and my life is kind of up in the air right now and some wonder what goes what comes next and so I'm just praying for guidance
 I feel happy every day every day I wake up and I can breathe and I can see and I can walk and I can talk and I can still shoot my photograph I'm happy it's just a good thing to be in the present moment and to be alive
 and you know what I figured I'd look at it regrets you can't change the past all you can do is change right here and right now so just move for it
 what advice would I pay myself don't let anything get in your way you know keep a good personality an energetic spirit and just keep pushing
 energetic talkative won't take no for an answer follow through reliable good-spirited giving loving
 I'm most proud of that I have been able to find out my creative side I've been a visual artist I never took an art lesson before I taught art I was in my late twenties before I even discovered that I can draw and paint I'm a doll collector I'm at my creative side is what I'm most proud of because it's been able to help me being creative I can no matter what even when I was still very ill from having a stroke I could still go out and just go take pictures and that was so soothing to myself that I'm glad I'm glad that I have a creative side of that I found it and have utilized it
 is that it
 why
 no that was kind of therapeutic that really was therapeutic. Go back here okay oh okay I'm sorry
