 so once again I ministered her up and then went to after she's done she'll tell you the environment
 pretty cool
 I'm not a therapist but I'm here
 and please
 I'm fine
 oh I'm feeling pretty good I had a little I was a little bit
 I wasn't sure what to expect when I got here but I feel pretty comfortable now
 I feel fine
 I'm very upbeat and in a good mood and happy
 Feeling Good
 great
 where are you from originally I'm from New Jersey born and raised in New Jersey
 went to basic training in New Jersey at Fort Dix drafted into the army when I was 17
 well
 I don't like it's just too crowded in La there's just too many people and it's just everybody to rush rush and
 I like a little more slow-paced
 but I do like the weather here so that's where I'm here and my family is here
 that's what brought me here
 do you travel a lot
 I traveled when I was younger when I got out of the military because I wasn't sure exactly what I was
 looking to do with my life and but now I'm kind of settled in and going to school for culinary arts
 in Hollywood and I have a fiance who graduated from USC and I'm pretty happy with my life
 but traveling not too much anymore now
 what do you enjoy about
 going to new places and meeting new people and seeing other parts of the country I haven't been to Europe but I hope to get there someday
 especially about it
 for credit number years I lived in Louis in New Orleans Louisiana took a trip there
 and enjoyed the food was fantastic and the music was fantastic and the weather was great
 and I loved it there
 and I took a truck back taking a trip to Las Vegas
 because I used to be a gambler at one time but
 not anymore
 that's about it
 I'd rather not talk about that
 well I'm currently enrolled in a culinary arts school
 but I got my GED in the military
 and so now I'm taking a culinary arts to be a chef
 I hope to open up a restaurant someday
 I'm going to school I'm going to school in
 and I work part-time
 my dream job is to own a bed and breakfast with my fiance that's my dream job
 and I hope to make that come true within the next year or two
 do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
 probably more shy than not going I was much I was very shy when I was growing up but I'm still shy but I'm trying to break out of my shell so to speak
 well my mom and dad are no longer with us they passed on
 and I have a sister in Northern California
 we were never close so we don't communicate very much and
 which is probably partially my fault parsley her fault we just don't seem to have a lot in common to show
 my mom passed away and that was pretty rough she was pretty sick by dad passed away about 9 years ago from Alzheimer's so
 we had a good relationship.
 to relax I just like to go take walks take long walks on the beach
 read a book
 watch live sports on TV
 I love the outdoors so I love to get out and exercise whenever I can that's what I do
 how are you
 very good very good
 very good
 I don't have a temper I don't get mad very out it takes a lot for me to get very very mad at somebody I'm cutting easygoing guy
 no
 no not really and I I try to avoid trouble whenever I can sometimes you can't avoid it but I try
 I'm fine
 probably arguing about with my roommate about making too much noise when he gets up in the morning and you know silly things like that but
 when you live in that kind of environment you have to learn to live with other people and
 it's kind of rough but you do the best you can
 I like you. I don't really want to discuss that later would rather not I'd rather avoid that question
 all right
 what's something you feel guilty about
 probably
 not getting enough education when I was younger and I had problems in school and
 running away from home when
 disappointing my family things like that I had a bad childhood due to my fault though she not theirs but I made the wrong decision which I'm paying for now so
 but we have to move ahead
 the hardest decision I had to make was
 putting my mom to rest
 thought that was the hardest and it's been about 2 years now but
 I'm still not over that one so that was the hardest
 she was my best friend so
 now she's gone
 my early years before I went into the military I didn't have many friends I was very shy very bad in school I wish I would have paid more attention
 I probably in better better position now but
 it's too late to worry about that now so we have to move on
 and with the acquisition support and help with my fiance that's what I'm doing
 have you ever served in the middle
 yes I was in the Army in Vietnam back in the day when I was 17
 how is your food service worker in the military
 many years ago
 17 I was drafted
 19
 7 / 70 or 71 I can remember it's been a long time
 I was drafted I didn't have a choice and really so
 how was drafted
 so I went in the army
 which was a good experience actually
 yes I am
 yeah and now I'm getting help from the military so that's a good thing
 no I was Stateside all the time I was in the military I was stationed in New Jersey
 Georgia Texas
 that's right I'm respected Fort Hood Texas
" it was well do the fact that I didn't go overseas or she combat it was fairly easy you know it was hard leaving home at that young age but it was fairly easy I didn't have much
 I missed him a lot and miss my family but it was okay it was a good experience I'm glad I did it
 that's when I started traveling traveling a lot because I didn't know
 are we still young and I wanted to see the country and travel around work here work there good job you got a job there just thought I should have been going to the school and while I was young and getting it having a decent job now instead of starting at the age of 60 but they say it's never too late so here I am
 I'll be okay I'll be alright
 well it turned me into a man that's for sure
 yeah and maybe become no more responsible
 learn to take learn to be on my own
 well I have my good days and bad days because I'm on this new medication for depression so some days I don't feel good and
 I have other medical issues I have breathing problems and I have
 some other medical issues but most of the time I feel pretty good but there are they there are good days and bad days
 I just take it one day at a time
 have you noticed any changes
 well I just know I don't sleep well matter fact I hardly sleep at all which is not good
 and then like I say I have my depressing days and days where I just don't have any energy and don't feel like doing anything and then
 I have my good days with my fiance to go to the best because she's my
 pride and joy
 without her I don't know where I'd be
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep very difficult very difficult about 3 to 4 hours a night last night I woke up at about 3 in the morning and I never could go back to sleep
 that's not good but yeah my sleeping is very bad
 it seems to get worse and worse everyday
 I'm not quite sure how I guess just I don't have the answer to that question I don't know
 never used to be that way
 all right I don't know
 well
 I have no energy and I get grouchy I'm very restless
 tired of course because I haven't slept
 I do the best I can
 have you ever been diagnosed
 I'm not sure what that is I don't know what that is
 well I don't know what that is I was never diagnosed with anything but you know they want to put me on some sleeping pills but I try and stay away from as much pills as I can I really don't like to take a lot of medications but there's some medications I have to take
 such as I have medications for my anxiety and my depression things like that I have to have those but other than that I'd rather stay away from medications if possible
 well I have the I have anxiety
 attacks that I've had for the last three or four years would you put me in the hospital but as long as I stay up on my medication I'm okay but I have stomach problems
 I'm just other issues
 so it's just a day-to-day thing I deal with it the best I can
 I don't know I'm not an I really don't know I just like I started do some
 problems when I was losing my I thought I was losing my eyesight because I had my iPod with popping out to do a thyroid problem I had and so they put me on this medication that I can't get off of now I've been on it for about 4 years 5 years and I'll probably out the rest of my life I have to take it twice a day or I will end up in the emergency room which I have before
 but I'm okay
 all right
 how do you cope with them
 I just try and I just deal with it the best I can go out and
 take a walker
 engaging some physical activities you know go to the beach like I said before and things like that keep my mind occupied
 how's the best way
 okay
 well because I wasn't sure what was wrong with me and I was just because I was feeling sick every day
 which is not natural so I had to go see a doctor psychiatrist not because I'm crazy just because I needed some help some medication and they gave me this medication that they did tell me that it was addictive
 and it's highly addictive and I've been on it for like I said about four years now and I'll probably be out of the rest of my life so but it keeps me
 feeling okay
 I can deal with things
 well I have an appointment tomorrow is a psychiatrist and yes I do
 not that often as long as I keep on my medication I'm okay
 do you feel therapy is useful
 well the last time I was in therapy with the psychiatrist all they did was
 it wasn't very much of a help because they were talking to me about my family and things like that and they weren't really helping me any so
 I don't go to therapy that often it's not a regular thing
 I just go to see a psychiatrist and that was the first time I've gone and it just all session lasted about 10 minutes how's your family where they live blah blah blah blah blah blah
 nothing about me and my problems and I never went back so I do have an appointment tomorrow with a different psychiatrist to see if I can get some more help and because I find Working is very hard because of my problems with my stomach and my breathing and if so I'm trying to
 hopefully get on some disability you know I'm 60 years old and
 finding a job especially in these times is not that easy so we'll see what happens
 because I don't I need it I need some income you know and I can't be little bit too young to retire so I need to be put on disability
 so hopefully I get some help
 none actually none
 sad to say but it's true
 like I said I don't go on a regular basis so it's been a while I will see what happens tomorrow
 when was the last
 I feel pretty happy right now
 and we want I want to wish my fiance I'm always happy because she's a very puppy positive person and we're in love and
 nothing like being in love
 so that's what I'm most happy when I'm with her because we have a lot in common and we have fun together
 I love her
 she's very supportive
 yes she has been for the last 3 years
 well I met her when she she's a paralegal and I met her during the time when my mom passed away and she was worth for the attorney that was helping us with the selling of the house Friday of the money in this and that we kind of went out for a cup of coffee and we started to
 enjoy each other's company
 friendly dependable and reliable
 well is my 60th birthday the other day
 and show me my fiance made me a nice dinner and we spent the weekend together and we went to the beach and
 we just had a good old time sitting in the backyard
 barbecuing
 enjoying ourselves
 that was great
 yeah I was right
 well that I'm 60 years old and still have a full head of hair and still fairly healthy and
 about to be married
 that's what I'm most proud of right now
 found somebody to love me and somebody that I love
 that's great
 thanks for sharing your thoughts with me thank you
 goodbye
