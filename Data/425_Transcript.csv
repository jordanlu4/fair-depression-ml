all right
 okay thank you
 and please
 are you okay with
 yes
 I'm okay doing a little tired and worried
 well I am looking for a place to live and I don't have a job right now so things are you sore a little
 shaky for me
 these days
 where do you live I'm staying with my son in Venice
 it's pretty good but both of us need to have our own space so that's why I'm looking for another place to live
 originally from New York but I've been in California since the early 70s
 yeah
 I moved to LA because I had been living in Portland Oregon and I was getting tired of the weather up there and my son was down here so it seems like a good place to be
 how easy was it for you to get used to living in LA
 and it wasn't too hard I I met people right away and I just really liked it here so it was it was easy to connect with people
 the weather is number one for most people I love being near the ocean I like the energy I like if they are like the artistic culture
 well everybody loves the traffic and me loves the weather and hates the traffic so I kind of feel I feel the same way sometimes it gets a little wearing that it's so busy and the fact that it's so expensive makes it difficult
 I see what you mean
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer
 you travel a lot
 I know not as much as I'd like if if I had more and more income more friends I would travel more
 I mostly have been
 may I travel as let's say so my longest trips it was out of the country was to Mexico and I traveled drove down with a friend down to Oaxaca and the whole trip we took about about 4 weeks going down and back from the Bay Area
 yeah that was a fun trip
 well we've been working together on the census and if she had made that trip a few times and invited me to come along with her
 from that trip I would say we were in Oaxaca for a Day of the Dead so it was celebrating Day of the Dead with the family in the little village that we were staying in at everybody in the village makes an altar in their house for their loved ones who have passed away and
 they also decorate clean and decorate the graves so there were lots of flowers and it was just it was neat to be there and be with that family celebrating that
 I studied I was in the liberal arts program but I didn't stay stay only stay in school for in college for a couple of years but I was most interested in Liberal Arts and Humanities
 dream job
 my dream job would be personal assisting somebody who was in a creative field and getting to travel and go to events with them
 how hot is it
 it's hard to break into I'm starting now very minimally with somebody who I'm doing more of a volunteer work with and I'm I'm working on building up some of my skills so that I can be doing more of that
 I'm fairly I'm kind of a friendly introvert so you know I have no trouble meeting people I don't hold back and you know I just am not like shy at parties I'll go up and talk to people but I am over all kind of introverted so
 I prefer one-on-one then big groups
 I like to watch I like to watch improvement shows like HGTV I like to watch
 I agree model shows and and see Transformations or watch movies or read I play some Solitaire on my my Kindle Fire
 okay
 how are you at controlling your temper
 I don't usually realize I'm mad until later it doesn't really come up and I just tend not to have the kind of life where
 those situations arise us sometime soon of sometimes on the road I get a little annoyed I don't get annoyed so much I like when people cut me off or anything like that but when people are deliberately rude and and you know honk for no reason or
 you know it when they get angry because maybe I've done something inadvertent nail cut them off by mistake and you know like they get really angry then that makes me angry and return
 When was the last time you argue with
 yeah I like I said I don't really get into arguments
 I did have I was with a friend the other day and
 she got annoyed with me because she felt like I was correcting her
 so it wasn't really an argument but she
 I had said something that she heard as a correction while it was a correction and she got angry
 well then I felt criticized and I felt I felt vulnerable I wasn't it was it was pretty uncomfortable
 well in that situation I didn't I didn't have to correct her
 so
 I think that's something I'm starting to look at in myself is my need to be right
 so in general that's I'm trying to to catch that and just let people
 make mistakes with without my telling them about it
 I don't know
 that's Tuff
 I can't know that I've had that much trouble making decisions
 well
 hard for me to decide to put my cat to sleep when he was sick
 oh it was and I had to give up a cat
 and I was moving once and and that was difficult to
 well in the case of the first cat the one that was sick
 I decided when the vet said that he thought it was the Humane decision
 and with cat I had to give up I didn't I
 didn't really decide I was moving to a place that where I couldn't take her
 and so I thought I found somebody who could take her
 say that stuff
 I don't really have that the erasing from the memory part
 there's nothing I really wish I could erase from my memory
 trying to think of something that I've done that I
 wish I hadn't done
 oh okay I remember something they were there was a time when I was I was in a class at Junior College it was a film class and I was I was the one who was after we we went out and did a little film project
 and we're supposed to bring it back into class the next week I was the one who had the film and through different just things that were happening in my life right now and never went back to the school but I never brought them to film back so all the work they have done I had to do over again and I still feel bad about that
 but it's pretty easy sometimes I wake up in the early morning hours and and have trouble going back to sleep but that's not very often
 how to concealing lately
 I've been feeling kind of tired and low-level depressed like not feeling a lot of options
 no
 yes I have
 oh there were two times there was once back in like 1970
 290 about 1972 or 3 and then
 another time
 oh so then would that have been in bed 16 years ago
 just feeling like there wasn't
 you know feeling the feeling that things weren't going to change
 if I didn't get some help and that if I
 I didn't have to let you know that maybe if I got some medication that would help me
 and the short-term
 I'm not going to therapy right now
 Travis moving around alot finances there wasn't really feeling the need starting to think it might be an option again
 I feel like therapy can be useful
 well when I went to therapy
 it was helpful to have somebody who listened and could also
 offer impartial suggestions for helping me to improve the way I was feeling
 I was on the beach last weekend was beautiful day and I was sitting in the sun and just relaxing I had my notebook can I was doing some writing and I felt very happy and content
 I'm kind and compassionate and I'm a good listener
 and I'm intelligent and I have five good ideas
 well I wish that
 sometimes I wish I was a harder worker I'm not really willing to take
 low-wage jobs even though
 I need work so I just don't feel like I'm willing to do anything
 and
 I wish I could act as I said I had good ideas I have good ideas and I'm good at the the onset but I'm not really good on the follow-through so a lot of those ideas get started but then I don't take them the distance that's probably the the thing I'd like to change my myself the most
 10 or 20 years ago I'd give myself the advice to go back to school and get my degree
 finish my education
 and be willing to
 to work a regular job and two
 to start putting money away for my retirement
 what are you most proud of in your life
 proud of my children and I am proud of the friendships I have and I'm proud that
 that
 people people do admire me and value my opinion
 goodbye goodbye
 okay
 okay
 thank you
