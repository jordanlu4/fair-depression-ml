 Virginia
 I wanted to live somewhere different than Virginia with a little bit more of diversity
 once a year maybe
 add song it's a lot slower and there's a lot left to do there
 I wanted to live somewhere different and a nicer warmer climate and somewhere where there's a lot more to do and I was a lot more going on
 for me it was really easy cuz I wanted some it was very different and I wanted something different
 I like I like all the things to do like the Museum's I like the beaches in the mountains and all the hiking and all the free things to do
 people don't appreciate what they have here that just come here and want to take something but they don't want to give anything back in bad drivers
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot
 not as much as I'd like to I travel whenever I can but usually can't afford to you that much
 well I like taking I like taking pictures a lot and I just like exploring new places my wife and I like to see you
 wildlife and Hiking monuments and to seeing different areas
 well we
 we've got we went to Central California we'd like to be able to go more internationally places but that takes a while to afford so we've gone more locally so we went to we went to Hearst Castle in the C the C the elephant seals and things like that
 I guess
 I guess our Palm Springs trip for our anniversary we did the who did the tram in the nice hotel on the jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall
 guess somewhere in between
 English and film
 well I am
 was told I needed to go to college in I haven't quite decided what to do yet so I just pick something I like to do for the time being
 well wish I had not been pressured so I had more time to figure out what I wanted to I might have done something different like Physical Therapy but
 are you still working or not
 I know I've been teaching gymnastics which is something I used to do before
 what made you decide to do that
 I needed to not starve and it did it it didn't end up being as bad as I thought it would be so I went for it and ended up being kind of fun
 dream job is to have money and not have to work for it
 okay
 how are you at controlling your temper
 overall pretty gif
 I don't remember what about but it probably would have been few weeks ago with my wife
 all anyone that I've ever actually gotten upset and yelled always wish I wouldn't do that but sometimes when someone is not listening it drives me crazy
 now if I just saying something over and over and they're just clearly not listening it makes me really upset
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to me
 I don't know I I spent a lot of time on them but I don't I don't know what the hardest one is cuz it if I decide to go with something and you know it's usually for a good reason
 what's something you feel guilty about
 well I guess I feel guilty about moving to California in that I left my family and Virginia I mean I know I shouldn't but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like living there you know I'm the one that moved away so it's like I abandoned them
 well I mean I don't miss Virginia but I do miss them so I guess a little hard
 I have a good relationship with my
 with my wife with my in-laws with my mom dad and sister there's no problems everyone gets along well
 very close
 mean anything anything where someone gets hurt either physically or otherwise
 depends on how much exercise I have get a lot of exercise is pretty easy if I don't it's not
 kind of like right now just a little bit
 swelling out of it but not really too different otherwise
 how do you been feeling lately
 I'm just kind of run-down cuz my um my mother-in-law's is dying and we just spent like 3 days in the hospital and we're going to go back after this so not a lot of time to sleep
 just some
 just us just slower and more tired and a little more out of it that's all
 have you ever been tigers
 no
 now
 usually just when I'm having having a fun day either on my own or with my wife that's it's pretty easy for me just getting outside and and and Hiking or exercising not hard for me
 I'm not sure maybe I'm maybe like eccentric but in a good way hopefully
 is there anything you regret
 no

 be careful with your to be careful with your job to make sure you could keep from being injured and two
 I don't know just just your normal your normal kind of older kind of wisdom
 can you tell me about that
 not much just a really everyone realizes things when they get older they wish they had when they were younger
 what are some things you wish you can change about yourself
 I wish I could get rid of my back injury so I could get back into shape like I used to be at some the biggest thing right now
 not much to say just hurt my back at work and I just like to get past it cuz it's you know holding me back from doing a lot of things that's all
 smile like you used to do gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active or work out more and now I can only work out a little bit cuz it hurts too much
 tell me how you spend your ideal weekend
 probably like during that during the day going going on a hike or to a park with my wife and enjoying taking pictures and Wildlife and exercising and then at night you know if we watch a movie or go dancing or just something like that
 is proud of them proud of moving here and then I came here without knowing anyone and I was at a point where I could have stayed in Virginia and gotten comfortable and you know ended up doing something I regretted but I came out and I've always thought that was a good decision
 my parents my grandparents my wife most people in my life have been
 I think I got everything I need
