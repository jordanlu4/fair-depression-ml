 at the door
 hi I'm Ellie
 are you okay with this yes
 how are you doing today I'm doing really good
 I'm from Granada Hills California it's the San Fernando Valley part of Los Angeles
 I love the weather I like the diversity in people I like how you can go to a neighborhood and it's not just one racer kind of food I love the beaches all the activities you could go do the theme parks aquarium stuff like that museums
 this smog
 there's a lot of creepy guys
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I've pretty much child around La I've been cross-country and back three times twice with when I was 17
 what do you enjoy about
 I like meeting new people and trying different foods and seeing how other people live
 I want to hear
 when I was seventeen I ran away with my boyfriend to Upstate New York to Watertown it was a like a Navy Army kind of town we had an apartment there are it snowed a lot we sold antique Spirit living
 awesome
 getting calluses pressed houses for the Sunset Strip Music Festival through friend and getting to meet rock stars and hang out I like the private parties
 I'm very outgoing I love people
 sometimes when I'm feeling
 what is the fastest guy
 what do you do
 am I go to the gym and work out quite a bit I find it helps relieve stress and keeps my energy level going I really notice if I don't work out a couple of days I feel a little more tired than normal and is it helps me feel good
" I'm pretty good at it I'm very
 I had a drunk friend that was just falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people and I kind of started getting loud like just telling her to stop doing that I didn't know that she was embarrassing and what she was saying to people was very mean and you know and I wonder like if you're talking to people like that they might not like it and they could attack you or something you know you never know it is LA
 what's something you feel guilty about
 I really don't feel guilty about anyting decisions I've made in my life I think I've made really good decisions and I always stick with my moral compass what I'm doing I grew up in church so I haven't gone in years but I still have those values and you know the rules the Ten Commandments and stuff in my head
 I had a slumlord landlord and I wish that I called you know the proper authorities and follow through on a court case instead of letting him like kind of bully me out because it wasn't up to code
 a few years back I was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back to where he was from and after a few months you know he was coming early and going back home I decided to move there and I had just started you know this business is doing event planning was picking up and I decided to leave there and try to do it there and you know on the east coast and it didn't work out but it was tough deciding like should I leave LA and make this jump and try something new and experienced something new or stay and what I was doing
 I was I had a degree in Dental Assisting I did that for like a year I didn't like it and then I was sending Communications like radio and television broadcasting and journalism
 I'm somewhere I'm doing a van work and I wrote for a magazine a couple years and I'm trying to like get a website going and then have like where I'm controlling my own riding and what's going on instead of writing for someone else
 I always wanted to ride and was always into the news and music and art growing up I really like Connie Chung she was like a Channel 4 newscaster in the eighties and I love Barbara Walters
 I was a nerd
 relationship with your
 tell my sister she doesn't talk to any of the family and I have a good relationship with my mom I never really knew my dad it doesn't bother me
 I have cousins and stuff but everyone's scattered across the country so I don't really talk to them and phone we just communicate on Facebook or like Twitter
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep so I go right to sleep when I get tired I just go to sleep
 how you been doing lately three good energetic I've been motivated to go look for more van work you know event planning stuff and really grinding in more than I was
 I mean it's kind of hard cuz you got to talk to people and get them to trust you and see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else
 I mean I'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer the one I know dies
 I want to say that I'm just super like oh my God happy all the time but it's like an even Keel that I feel pretty good all the time
 I'm very talkative and friendly and I could approach strangers and talk to them Eddie's and I could adapt to different situations and even if it's not my scene or situation or group of people that I'm used to I could still jump in talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adopt
 what are some things you wish you could change about you
 I want to make more money
 I'm over in like second grade the people used to make fun of me cuz I was very tall and skinny and I had like straight A's were in the highest grades and Lacrosse so people would make fun of me and call me giraffe
 stuff like that
 very talkative she would just say that I talked to everyone
 and I'm very friendly and if you need help that I'll help someone you know
 a recently I went up to Oceanside and visited a friend I've known years and we just went out for burgers and hang out on the beach and we got her two-year-old son and like chicken in the park and played and it was really nice and they was cool visiting or I didn't seen her in six months and it was really fun and I want to go again and
 I like the area
 I guess maybe I could be trying to find my own work more like for my business instead of working for other people
 I think I pursue it but I think maybe I could put a little more time and day into it
 tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase her memory
 I don't really know anything like
 that we want a raise or not happen
 okay
 is there anything you regret
 no I feel good about my choices I made and I think I'm on the right path and a lot of things I wanted to do than balls rolling and I'm you know getting things done I'm not as big as I want to be but I feel like I'm on my way there
 advice would you give yourself 10 or 20
 I'm like 10 years ago I would have told myself to work more in the daytime instead of going out as much as I was
 my friend we call Mojo
 Mojo has a magazine and I just wrote years and he really pushes me to like keep riding and keep doing the Vance and keep on the ball I'm rolling and he's one of the biggest people you know my life tummy you're talented you could do it you know he's just a really good like motivation for me
 you know being published I've been on TV shows and just getting my own event thing going and
 I have a lot of people who read what I ride everyday and follow-on I just think it's a you know it's not exactly honey where I want to be but it's great start
 and I work to get to that point
 great thanks
