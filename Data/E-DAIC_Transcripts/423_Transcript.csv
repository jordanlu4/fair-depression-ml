and please
 yes
 feeling well
 where are you from originally Los Angeles the Greater Los Angeles area
 people
 diversity and
 various entertainment and activities
 fickle weather
 traffic and litter
 do you travel
 I have travel domestically not internationally
 seeing other places and how people live in the culture
 I want to hear about one of your trips
 the last trip that I went to a San Diego
 butt out
 from childhood or as an adult
 family vacations to Baja in Rosarito Beach
 can you tell me
 yeah the reason why that memory comes to mind because this weekend is Easter and we usually will go down to East Easter spring break to Rosarito Baja
 am I have a Bachelors in communication studies
 because of the open field just doesn't deal with them communication interactively but Performing Arts telecommunications business entrepreneurship so
 no I'm not at Maxey unemployed
 what's your dream job
 I think 200 my business that's my dream my dream job to have my own company
 I would like to open something like the Telecommunications area
 as a business something do online online services I like to make things with my hands so my next venture with would be to create all-natural soy candles
 something in that area
 a mixture
 mixture of shy and outgoing because I have to observe people in crowds and that's how I usually make a determination if I remain reserved remain open
 I listen to like a meditation tape or I take a walk or go get a massage
 Fair
 oh man I probably yesterday or this morning usually the argument is about me making myself clear Army repeating myself twice
 no usually gets the other person in trouble
 tell me about a situation that you wish you would have
 I redeemed a service from a mechanic who fix my transmission and I had a warranty and I wrote to the Department of Consumer Affairs and the guy offered me a portion of the settlement agreement and I decided to take him to small claims court to get a bigger amount and I wish I would have have
 taking the offer that he gave me at the midst of dealing with a third party which was the Department of Consumer Affairs and because of that I took him to small claims court and I end up losing the whole settlement and only been offered a very small portion so I wish I would have taken the higher road to taking a lower Road
 I don't tend to feel guilty about too many things
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
 hardest decision
 I don't know financially emotionally
 emotionally letting go of past relationship the hardest thing to say the hardest thing but it was a difficult thing
 can you tell me about
 yes it was a relationship of 7 years but that person is already moved on
 so they want me to be in their life and hopes that if something goes wrong with my current relationship will always have something to fall back on
 that sounds really hard
 oh yeah it is hard
 tell me about your bag or something that you wish you could erase from your
 in advance
 so that I can trace for my memory
 I don't know there's a lot of events that I just automatically erased from my memory but whatever comes to mind right
 probably the death of a relative
 I'm alone and misinformed
 because I didn't know that they were that sick and I didn't know that they were their days were numbered
 and I could have had more opportunity to spend time with them and make better a better connection in the last days
 I'm sorry to hear that
 tell me about your relationship with you
 is Fair to Midland
 are you into your family
 my immediate I'm very close but distant not very close
 okay
 my mother
 tell me about
 and yes I she's encouraged me to continue my education to always fall back on my hobbies hopes golden dreams she always encourages me to always stay loose and out there looking for a better opportunity
 and she encourages me to not be afraid to explore other Ventures
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 easy
 I've been feeling well
 yes a little stressed but I'm trying to manage that
 I leave the stressful environment
 in the past
 about 3 years ago
 because I was having issues in my learning environment
 and I was feeling emotionally attached
 yeah I was having an issue with a professor who was just very
 I know you have a very different personality
 he almost ran me down the crosswalk at school
 how do you feel
 I felt I felt like I was in a dishonest environment I felt
 like I wanted to get you know switch his class and get into another class but I had no choice but to stay in there and deal with his meanness for the whole semester
 have you been diagnosed with depression
 I think through finding PTSD they were trying to link depression
 you still go to therapy now no
 financially
 I'm not capable and I haven't found a counselor who's willing and committed to working with me and helping me with my issues
 I find a lot of counselors they listen to me and then they laugh at me and then they tell me the opposite of what's what I'm telling them
 last time I felt really happy I really don't know that's a good question
 something you did recently that you really enjoy
 just just do what I want I just relaxed
 I just relaxed and
 you know I don't know
 I don't have any best friends
 my best qualities that I'm hard-working I'm reliable I'm an excellent friend
 I'm energetic
 and I'm going to go get her
 things that I wish I could change about myself probably be less sensitive
 don't take things so personally
 and
 learn how to help myself before helping others
 no I don't have any regrets in my life
 if I could do things differently 10 years ago I probably would have
 focus and study more
 and less
 being out of the house and hanging with friends
 what are you most proud of in your life
 baguette have a college education and I'm self-sufficient
 and
 I can pay my bills by myself and
 I'm alive
 goodbye
 hi
 so then where you at that was exactly
