this is super need I like this
 me either at all can you do it at home
 wow
 okay
 alrighty
 yes I am
 hopefully fine thanks for asking
 I'm originally from California born and raised and I live in Carson at the moment
 all of the beaches the sun in the amusement parks
 the traffic LA traffic is hectic
 not really
 I read and I listen to soft music like jazz or something
" I don't like people to walk in front of me don't excuse me cut me off in traffic when I'm driving I don't like a Tailgater little small small
 I'm pretty good at controlling it sometimes but at times I can get very irate so I'm working on that right now
 do I have an argument almost a year but when I did it was over a girl that was my ex boyfriend it was over female but it's over now so I haven't had any real argument since almost a year
 I studied in college I did a child of element and I also study computer science
 right now I'm a homemaker I don't work at all I haven't been working in about 3 months now was laid off but I was doing receptionist work so I'm currently looking for employment at this moment
 my dream job is all my own design Graphics computer shop which means I'm when you do your you grab your designs online and you send them to different distributors and what they do is they approve or they approve or disapprove what you put they like or dislike about the design so they went ahead with it they'll buy them for me and then they'll go from there
 I don't know I used to in the past but not at the moment
 when I was with my daughter my mom it was very delightful we stay from was 2 weeks and it was not even two years ago it was very very nice and I wish I can go back to the beaches for beautiful the food is great the blue owls are great at night it was really really nice a great experience
 very close to my mother and my daughter were all three were like sisters we can be any closer
 my parents my grandparents who have now gone there if they're past but they were a very positive influence in my life my guy friend that I'm dating now he's very positive in my life so
 I have a lot of backbone support you can say
 I don't right now because I'm living with my mother step dad I'm trying to move someplace on my own now but it's kind of hard not working at all so I just have to wing it out so I can do better
 no it's just myself my daughter my mom and my stepdad at the moment
 no I haven't
 yes I have
 almost 2 years now
 no I had no idea
 just always feeling down and out cleaning myself in not want to be bothered with other the outside world just a little mood swings and just can't sleep at night all all kind of little stuff that kind of got me feeling like something wasn't right about me
 yes I do
 yes I do it's very useful
 it is very much so
 reason why I feel like it's helping me is because the lady NYC there the therapy place she's very nice she she's willing to help out in any way she can she's almost to be like a psychiatrist she's very good I mean she talked to me about things encourage me to what not to do what you do to help calm down to feel better and she's very nice or all-in-all I always leave their confidence all the time
 number one of my mood swings I've noticed a big change in that and my attitude
 affected me in a great way I would never say negative because I like like I said it goes back to the helpfulness after scene from The Lady and I'm a therapist and
 the different ways I was coached on how to improve my lifestyle to avoid the problem that I do have right now or suffer with so that's how it affected me that way
 the attitudes and mood swings can't sleep at night depressed all the time no outside company at all didn't want to be bothered with anybody friends or family locked up in my room all the time halfway not wanting to eat or overeating it was just a lot
 maybe like any little thing would trigger me off like somebody say something wrong to me that I would think was wrong it would just figured I would just get triggered and just snapped for no reason it's just I don't know what would cause it besides that
 well now I'm doing I'm coping with it by not snapping his medicine just trying to stay calm and I just need a lot of positive environment around me not negativity that helps to so with that being said I just kind of maintain and keep my high self-esteem up is As much as I can
 a lot better than before
 yes I have very positive thoughts very positive behavior much better than what it was very big improvement from before
 yes I have been for the past few months I've been feeling a little better
 I have at times but today no I'm feeling pretty upbeat
 it's not very easy but I try but for the past few nights I have a sleepy the full night so that's a positive for me
 very cranky very groggy Moody
 actually
 yesterday that we see something was up over the phone and I was happy the whole day I'm still kind of happy about a tattoo so that was very good for me
 my best friend is a male he would probably surprise me as upbeat always ready to go
 luv2eat
 just a fun person to be around
 no I don't got anything
 thank you for having me
 bye
 love it
