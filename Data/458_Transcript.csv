so you guys are controlling the virtual human okay
yes
 I'm doing fine thank you
 I'm from Los Angeles California yes
 I love man saying I like the weather I like the lifestyle I like the variety of beach know we have it all
 things I don't like about La the rent is way way way way too expensive it's ridiculous
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes
 I have I'm well-travelled
 nice
 enjoy.
 I enjoy seeing new places going new places it's different every where the people are different
 it's fun
 okay well the most recent is last year I went to family reunions in New Orleans so that was in June and while I was there we also visited Slidell Louisiana for the the swamp tours and Vicksburg Mississippi where my mom is from and we spent the night in Ferriday Louisiana with my aunt to will be 101 this year in May
 there's a lot as far as traveling or just.
 Most memorable experience and well I don't know if it's just one probably when
 I used to travel with my dad that's where I got a lot of my traveling from
 can you tell me about
 yeah it was best car sometimes planes mostly white just I guess I'll say mostly down south but it was really fun especially the road trips
 just a general and also drama
 what's your dream job
 my dream job is to become a real estate investor
 well I've sort of really been into it every since 2005 I just don't have the capital right now or the connections but since I do like real estate I'm just going to start off as a real estate agent so I should have my license sometime this year
 outgoing
 I'm well I'm not sure why it could be a little bit of both but I'm pretty outgoing
 well speaking of Hawaii I did live there for a year and a half but what do I do to relax is either I'm usually take a nap take a bath
 or just try to get things off of my mind and try to spend my energy in more positive ways
 it needs to be worked on but I know when to control it when I need to
 well me and my ex-husband still get into arguments is this just over a text message but I'm actually it was my fault but usually it's his but it just starts little and kind of snowballs out of control butt
 that's usually how it goes
 well I don't know what else to do except for pray on it because I thought once I moved into another house it would be over but I see that we're still getting into it so I don't know maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right than them be right I guess
 probably quite a few things but I don't regret anything I've done in my life but
 situation I wish I would have handled differently just
 kind of everything in my life almost I could have done it differently or I would if I had the chance but I'm not worried about it cuz I don't regret anything that I've done in my life
 tell me about
 the hardest decision probably when I had to get a divorce that that may have been the hardest a one of the hardest decisions
 it was just a lot of a lot of stuff through the years the relationship is kind of deteriorated the relationship between us was still good then the things that he were doing I would have been able to overlook it a little bit more because I would feel like well our relationship is good and it's difficult to find a really really good relationship but since our relationship deteriorated and there's just a lot of disagreement and arguing and problems financial problems and he's doing this so I
 I just decided just forget it I mean I tried but you know he didn't want to cooperate so
 well I'm happy with what's going on now I mean I wish that we could still be a family but since that's not going to happen yes I am happy with my life right now yes
 something I can erase
 I don't think I really need to erase anyting I finally got an over the way the kids treated me at school but other than that I can't think of anything to erase
 it's fair / good there is no problems right now so I guess I'll just say good yeah there's no problem
 well I would have to say my mother yes
 I'm with she's just always supported me and everything that I've done whether it's good or not so good so I think that's a blessing
 sometime sometime it's not
 well I just don't get enough hours of sleep I guess that's what it is cuz I would like to sometimes so that's more the problem I would like to get
 I'm just sleepy yeah sleepy tired feeling like I want to go take a nap
 I've been feeling fine
 I know they've been about the same
 have you ever been
 no
 no
 I'm really happy probably last week because I got over to a little bit of money so
 well I guess my best friend will be my mom or maybe my entertainment friend that I've been knowing since 96 I really wouldn't I'm not going to say I don't consider him a best friend that we don't really hang out that much but he is very ungenerous to me and my mom
 so
 well right now I spend my weekends doing chores and classwork and sleeping in
 but maybe after the class work is out of the way maybe I could do something else
 myself well I do wish that at times I could control my temper a little more and of course I would like to lose weight be a little bit more active and I wish my skin would clear up
 it was probably when I was in school school years or terrible for a lot of people because the kids are animals so they try to make you feel like you're nothing like your piece of turd on to their foot so that's probably the last time is an adult now
 I would say that I'm genuine I'm honest I'm supportive
 and I'm just a good friend
 no
 did you give yourself
 well 20 years ago just because you're pregnant that doesn't mean that you're eating for two and you can eat loads of food like people tell you that's the main thing I'm I'm going to tell my daughter's no I'm just eat as you normally eat the eat more healthier there's no need to gain 80 lb when the baby is just 20 pounds or less and you have all this weight to lose also know if I came into any money now 20 years ago I was probably just thinking about shopping or just kind of spending it on frivolous stuff where is now I would invest it
 so yeah I think that's about it
 proud of
 I guess maybe myself my kids
 hey thank you
 bye
