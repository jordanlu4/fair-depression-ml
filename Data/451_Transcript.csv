okay thank you
 and please
 are you okay
 yes
 okay other than this laryngitis I have
 a Cleveland Ohio
 in 79 I think it was
 once a year or something like that or less
 there's a lot more to do here
 they're a little more narrow-minded back there and Republican
 well originally Show Business
 but probably to get away from Cleveland
 it was very difficult at first
 I'm not used to change I don't like change very much you know having to
 meet new people and figure out how to make a living
 well
 I like the different opportunities you have the different the health Consciousness the movies
 the variety of things you can do the places you can go the weather
 the driving the congestion some of the superficial attitude
 the importance
 well not a lot but I do I just came back from Vegas to visit relatives we met there and I'm going to Mexico next month
 well seeing the different cultures like I've been to Europe Greece France Italy I like going to places such as Mexico or it's going to be sunny and just lying out I went to last year I went to Arizona and ever saw Sedona that was really
 an experience peaceful
 about Sedona
 yep well Sedona is a very energetic place and I thought it was Desert like flat kind of desert looking but it was very Rocky and when you land in Flagstaff there's these beautiful pine trees and the elevation is high and then coming into the doughnut was very beautiful and and after a day the pain in my back went away that I had there for months so anyhow this even though we went to bed late and got up early you had the energy so is really very mystical
 in life
 or incident in life
 well being on stage in Boston
 and that was great I love doing that
 just being with friends and laughing some of my highest moments when we were laughing hysterically
 well
 I don't know if a particular situation but when I when I decorate for special events and I worked with somebody on a regular basis and we would just find humor in everything and just laughing
 and I can't think of particular situation or what we were laughing at but just being with somebody who's in tune with my sense of humor and gets my jokes and you know I get his and we're just enjoying that moment
 speech and drama
 I am a traitor
 oh no not now
 I always was interested in
 musical comedy when I was a child I would sing along to records in my living room
 and I was always inquires in school and then when I
 went to HighSchool I join the drama club
 and I just always had an interest and I always had a big personality and
 well
 I don't know if I have a dream job anymore I'm 60 and
 I don't know if I have aspirations anymore to towards doing anything right now I just rather not work in chest
 relax and travel but
 I like being creative and in any way I can I like Independence and I kind of have that right now so
 I'm okay
 I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got
 well I I watched my favorite television shows that I've recorded
 and I also am a Buddhist I've been a Buddhist for
 gosh since 1988
 and I'm at District leader in my community and we have meetings and that really helps to Center me and bring out my higher self so if I get tense or nervous I I chant
 sometimes okay sometimes not
 a lot yes yes less and less though it's been happening less and less
 but
 yeah sometimes it's got its hit some created difficulties
 well
 I can't remember an argument I remember getting angry like was just when I was on my trip in Vegas I was driving and the GPS said stay in the left lane and I stayed in the left lane but when I get off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway about 4 miles out of our way and I just
 I got very angry for about 30 seconds and then I had to call myself down and say okay alright so we're going to be late and I had to talk myself out of it so it wasn't really an argument with anybody but I felt kind of bad that I overreacted
 you mean in my life many's yes
 Ashley so many
 I just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing information like they're not going to use me on a job or something that I would
 take an attitude that
 I'll find something better it's okay and move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me and you know did I do something wrong and then get angry at the Hammond
 you know that
 whole thought process that really doesn't help the situation
 can I do that more often but I since I started chanting but it doesn't you know I'm not always in my highlights get to where I can do that
 I find a lot of situations to talk to me like you know what television to buy yours but
 I guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences and
 or leaving my comfort place if the decision meant that I had to leave my comfort place that would be a very difficult decision for me
 and probably leaving a relationship
 very hard because
 it your I get dependent on that relationship so I usually live it out until
 that's for it. It's believed or something and it's very hard for me to make that decision that this isn't right and I have to move on so what I usually do is I don't make the decision and I end up suffering with longer
 cell
 can we move on
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 well it's hard because I don't know if it's because I have pain in my back
 and neck but it's difficult for me to stay asleep I I don't get it a deep sleep
 but
 because of it so it's hard to say because right now I have this cold and I've had it for 2 weeks so I've been taking Nyquil and that's been putting me to sleep so I have been sleeping better because of it but last night I had woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell but before that all happened
 I was
 finding it difficult to stay asleep
 and so therefore I'm tired during the day and
 sometimes I'm groggy sometimes I'm irritable
 but I'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or emotional things are or are not
 I'm sorry could you repeat that
 have I studied changes in my behavior
 no
 I was not
 no
 oh why I was like happy last week you know
 can you tell me about the
 well I
 was going to Vegas to meet my family with my my family is flying in from Cleveland to there we have a relative in Vegas and I drove with my friend
 and it was my brother-in-law 70th birthday so we all went and had a good time in Vegas and I was struggling through my cold but but it was fun it was nice
 well
 are they think I'm funny they feel that I say it like it is
 then they all say they understand me so people who don't understand me I think sometimes don't know how to take me cuz I'll I'll say something sometimes it come up come across sarcastic but that's just the way I talk
 so
 my the anger that sometimes Wells up in me you know I just but although that that really made me I think a lot of the person that I am you know all the all of your
 experiences make you who you are and how you handle them
 makes you who you are and if you don't have those Lowe's you don't really know what hyzaar
 so I don't I can't really go back and regret and I wish certain things didn't happen whatever but really what matters is today and now and how you handled today and I wish that well I can't I don't wish I know that I will have less of these moments where I just burned out you know anger or something I just wish that would happen more or less that anger Parts what happened less and they are so
 I guess it will
 having less
 don't give up hope live in the moment
 and
 everything will everything will work out everything will work out
 and if you believe that then you really have nothing to fear
 the fact that now and for the past 20 years 20 some years I've been cultivating myself and I've been I've become a more
 compassionate person
 and I'm able to
 understand people better and see that you know they're they're suffering too and that if you if you treat people from that respect if they're they have their problems too and they're suffering with their problems to you able to live a better life because you're not allowing that to affect you if you're not taking it personally and at the same time you're becoming more compassionate person and when you're more compassionate you're you're happy and your life is happy
 okay
