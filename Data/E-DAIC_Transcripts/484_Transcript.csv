okay
 yes
 I'm doing well
 I was born in Oakland
 all the different areas of the city the different cultures that are here
 the traffic the
 lack of public transportation and the superficiality
 I I don't I would love to travel more
 being able to experience a different way of living getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and getting a different perspectives
 I'm in 2008 I studied abroad in Brazil and that was about four months and I was in Bahia which is in the north and
 see the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a Homestay family
 I've always wanted to travel and I chose to Brazil because they have an afro Brazilian population or large after Brazilian population which I really want to learn more about and I think their history and their culture is really interesting
 I think taking a bus by myself to a remote beach and just navigating on my own and figuring out where to go
 right now I'm getting my masters in social work
 dream job I think to consult about mental health and
 how to
 how to intervene effectively with different cultures and doing a research and Consulting work and getting to travel
 basically that those would be the main characteristics
 I think that's a false dichotomy but I do consider myself shy but at the same time out going in the sense that I push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone and I'm determined to do what it takes to become successful
 I listen to music and just lay on my bed and I guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things also breathing exercises which I'm learning more about as well as exercise
 pretty good I don't get angry a lot so as far as angry temperament I'm pretty good at that
 what month is this may probably two months ago
 and I argued via text message so it's not really intense arguing but I guess you called arguing in a sentence over whether or not I should be forgiven for something that I thought was minor with a friend I've had for a few years
 I felt anxious sad and angry
 yeah those are the main emotions
 I know them because I think I'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them and then I'll notice the physical manifestations of emotions like if if my heart's racing or from getting sweaty
 if I'm if my breathing is more shallow I'll know I'm anxious so I'll know something is bothering me
 that I wish I had handled differently
 I guess related to this argument I went out one night and got a little too intoxicated and ended up calling a person for a ride home but that really upset that person and I know that it wasn't such a big deal but I wish I hadn't have let myself get to that point
 it impacted a relationship and I also felt really bad about what I did
 hardest decision
 wow probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into I briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards after dropping out I had to really rethink what it is that I wanted to do and what I wanted to dedicate my life to go into debt for spend a lot of energy on
 I think by recognizing what I don't want to do and doing a lot of research on program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program
 after think
 revolving around the same person I've spoke of earlier
 it was a dating relationship and a few years ago we had a falling-out over his treatment of me and involved another person and I wish I could get that out of my mind
 I have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the Bay Area I didn't grow up with her but I've gotten closer to her as an adult
 we talked pretty regularly with my dad I grew up with him mostly he lives in Atlanta and we don't talk as much but we are we were pretty soon relationship it's not really that contentious or anyting and I'm an only child so I don't have siblings I don't have a large family I'm so
 in general I'm not really that close to family
 one person is my mentor who I met in 2005
 and she's a judge and I met her when I was in community college and she really
 open my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that I would be able to achieve certain things
 is it for you to get it
 pretty easy well it's easy for me to sleep what's not easy is getting up
 because usually I do not look forward to what I have to do that day and the thought of it is you know just makes me want to stay in bed all so I wake up pretty tired and not really feeling refreshed
 I think just
 self talk about how would I have to do isn't that bad or that the things that I'm doing now or going to end pretty soon with the end of the school year trying to think of things that I can look forward to in the week also listening to music and browsing the internet kind of gets my mind going
 feeling
 oh wow feeling emotionally drained in some ways and at the same time feeling like I've accomplished a lot and I've grown so mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of
 feeling accomplished and proud at the same time
 no I haven't
 yes
 an 2006
 the convergence of a lot of stressful factors I was out of touch with my mom I started why I transfer to a university that was pretty rigorous and just all those changes going on really
 exacerbated things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there and it got to a point where I just felt really overwhelmed
 yes I do
 yes
 I notice I'm better able to
 accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them I'm
 able to think differently about things that happen maybe look at things in a more positive light
 and also identify the areas I need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas
 this past weekend I reconnected with some old friends and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again
 people have different takes on on me I don't have one best friend but I think people would describe me as very
 analytical
 sensitive intelligent
 intellectual
 I wish that I did not order it I wish I was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression which I'm working on and I wish that I had more energy
 start going to therapy now
 but yeah I really would and
 also
 to what house am I playing 10 years ago 18 okay so graduating from high school I would tell myself to pick up some more job skills that I wouldn't have to struggle as much in the future and to seek out mentors to get a clearer idea of what I wanted to do as a career
 I think the fact that I'm in grad school and coming from the background that I that I come from low socioeconomic status and just pushing through challenges to get here
 thanks for sharing your thoughts
 you're welcome
 bye
 okay
