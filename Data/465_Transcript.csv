Take the train to San Francisco hung out with some of my middle school friends for hella long then yeah it was crazy I was just walking usually arrive bikes everywhere but I was just like walking this this whole time and it was cool I was mad exploring I got I got back home eventually then after that I went directly to Texas and did some shows on the way going to Texas and stayed out there for 8 days
 and that was really nice of you crazy I don't even know man is so much happiness you know I had fun
 I went to this place called the Salton Sea and me a bunch of my bicycle friends we all we got in the car is in the way out into the desert and we yeah it was tight we were burning stuff we burn the car we drove the car was like a road warrior type of car and this is crazy man like it was like 50 niggars on one car it was like gnarly we got naked when do you stream I did have a shrooms did have a Molly smoke a ridiculous amount so we'd got retarded drunk so I try to give me some Mexican I don't want to do that but this is like in March before I went on the other trip is like the precursor to my other trip it was the Salton Sea trip but it was tight
 I saw a lot of nakedness that trip
 yeah really
 I'm hell out going how going for sure
 smoke weed
 okay
 what did I study
 photography photojournalism and yeah is that it got to use a computer for free. To get use bother as cameras for free and I was the Doolittle I would do man-on-the-street type shit with students not man on the street but the ones that you take a picture and say like I forgot what it was called it was long ago
 nah nah nah nah Nee more

 I rap that's what I do I do little shows around the country and stuff I got a little fan base and I'm sorry you know I'm just doing that he's doing all right I draw to my my dream job is not working a job and being me that's the dream job getting paid for being me so I asked there
 I'm pretty good
 back 2 weeks ago that is after hours one I was already like super drunk and tools after hours 3 was after hour or so like man had a bunch of pins these do you take my pens away pins in my like fanny pack I'd like a fanny pack by pins in there cuz I do art is like not. You can't take this anymore I'm like okay for sure let me just leaving right here and I'll get it when I come out I'll come out and they're gone actually knock a beer over and he gets mad at me like you got to go now I don't like that wasn't my fault that was your fault but then why that happened my homie was getting like ambushed by the three big ol security guards and then you know what I saw it Ben Hanscom my friend that's when I really lost it and I and the other good luck on my friend right now he's like what you going to do it said I'm like what you going to do and then I hit the ground yet is all over me I put my arm around him and do him to the ground and then it got broken up
 that was the last time
 I got angry
 it was cool as fun
 life
 maybe that maybe that situation could have been handled differently it could have been handled differently if they would have been handling things differently than I wouldn't have to react it's not like I was mad I was acting awful reaction I had to act like that because like justice that I couldn't it was on Jessie was like I'm not a mean person at all but when I saw one of my loved ones to get it tagged I had the Black come and like you know like react to that and they were the hot and I mean I was like yeah yeah I think is a tripping like yo chill out is the tiny little white dude your humongous ass Mexican eggs are you need to fall back and I mean it's crazy
 guilty
 I don't know I still should sometime from stores when I'm hungry so I got no money I got and I really guilty actually yeah I don't feel guilty about that food should be free and I mean I don't know I like everybody laughs sometime I lie sometimes I feel like a little like idle here and there exaggerations
 nah nah never
 the hardest
 I guess I don't even know what the hardest decision was but I get face with hard decisions and those would be like I got so many friends sometimes I can't really hang out with everybody in one weekend cuz I got to make this is like if I go over this sector the town I'm going to hang out with XYZ niggars I go over here XYZ evening so it's like you know those are hard decisions cuz I never like to let anybody down so that stuff like that deciding between friends to hang out with
 house

 she's just really nice and she's like a little sweet little blind old lady who cooks really good and it's tight I don't know
 something I could erase for my memory I want to want to erase anything from my memory
 cuz that'll be like because like the experiences you go through make you who you are who you are I think we've people like that want to erase things or block things out like that doesn't exist I mean there should that's been hard but I would never say I would not want that to happen cuz you know you must have got to learn from the experience you know I mean to be the better you all I see is like a it's like a test you know that bad experience was just testing you got over come and be stronger and not just like curl up and be like oh my God life hard that shitt I don't believe in that I have compassion for people who do get a who do want to do stuff like that but I still like I don't see the logic in it
 I mean I stay up pretty late and do all sorts of a regular stash it but when I am home it's really easy I can just go to sleep you know when I get tired I get tired
 lately I've been on this site I've been partying hell it's tough lately like oh my God for at least six days late today coming to do this talk to you was the first time I've been able to come back to Culver City since like Friday cuz I've been downtown and there's like Cinco de Mayo and there was actually a random ass party that went to the homies
