how long should this person last
okay
 sure
 I'm doing okay it's Friday
 where you from
 I'm originally from Alabama from the Gulf Coast born and raised
 if I put my glasses on her
 I like the
 I like the weather in general it does kind of hot and sometimes it's a little overbearing but I like that you could go from the beach within an hour to the mountains with their self so that's that's pretty that's that's pretty diverse I guess I like that
 I don't like the traffic it's sometimes it's just it's it's crazy and
 an unbearable also don't like the the weather conditions given the smog and so forth which can be a little bit if you live in the valley it's just me I was just a big Heat ball be a little bit unbearable as well
 I used to travel a lot I used to when I was in the Army I lived in in Germany so I used to travel every chance I could take over every weekend I would travel throughout Germany now so much so I don't travel this much since I'm still married and so forth but I used to travel more or less more International than than anything
 I mostly in George's hanging out and meeting new people I also I love history so when I remember when I was in Prague I would love taking a reading about something in the context of my travels and and and and applying at to the the current meow Museum or whatever I remember when I went to South Africa when I was in Cape Town at the same thing you did you know you're reading a lot of books in the contacts and then you go and you see it and it's like well you know it's not just getting it off the internet or anything like that so I enjoy that
 okay well I
 couple years back I was in South Africa and I was doing research for for for college until I was there working for a private Equity Firm and even before I got there at Nelson Mandela's book with 500 page biopic kind of thing in action making it to the movie but I read it and I was like you know I'm going to check this out so I went to Robben Island which was pretty cool where it was Kept For about 25-30 years and the city reminds me of San Francisco and if you're going to San Francisco but the city reminds me of San Francisco steep Bluffs right off the coast of the Indian Ocean there but I enjoyed it I had a I had a great great time taking in the sights and you get to see a lot of the Dutch Colonial stuff and you know and all that kind of just mix in
 together and it's a great wine to have a lot of grape Vineyards Vineyards down in that part of the South
 and Cape Town or just in general are in traveling
 at school I studied I studied business I studied Finance and Accounting so I
 I kind of had a minor in military studies are military science is what it was called and undergrad but for the most part I studied finance and in grad school I studied Finance and Accounting
 I I write and I do Consulting
 so I do Consulting for finance so I I do about 50/50 riding and then Consultants.
 my dream job is to be JJ Abrams so that's my dream job actually I would love to do just got to do something more creative flashlight but I consider is creative is is is the thing that interests me is because you get to create all these different packages and bundle them and derivatives that's no different from writing to me you know so it's the same thing so I just want to do something that's kind of creative and that's kind of aligned to just looking at new things in a different way and that's the way I've always been
 I'm in general Eminem Morven I'm more of an outgoing kind of guy that's just but you know I don't mind you know when I'm home I'm kind I don't turn on the TV and and do whatever I'll pick up a book and I'll read a book as opposed to you know
 you watching TV or playing Xbox or whatever so that's that's me
 why because the other stuff doesn't seem it's interesting you know I think there's a lot of things that are really interesting and and and and and usually using your imagination and then picking up a book it's just kind of raw it's just you know Sun filter kind of thing so that's that's me
 I have a great relationship with my family
 I
 have a wife and kids I also have a family is back in Alabama and Georgia and for my immediate family we we know I have to divide my time between that my only interest in my family but we do a lot of great things that are centered around the kids my wife is moral as an East coaster so she's from New York area so we do things that are
 turn around her and him do things for the kids cuz the kids have interest so we I just tried to balance it and I have my stuff do some kind of last but we do have a lot of diverse interests which is great
 what do I do to relax
 I
 I would my I'd like to go
 I I like I think I'm pretty good at controlling my temper I'm more of a laid-back kind of guy I mean I'm that kind of guy you know I'm a little bit you know you just you know at some point you know it enough is enough but I I'm pretty I'm pretty polished and how I have done you know you know being an army been an army officer when I was in the military and going through all the cadet training and stuff you really do a lot and how they interact with management and so forth so I'm okay with track with my temper and everybody has their breaking point and what I do to relax I like to go for a walk mostly I like to be outside
 I probably shan't argue with ya sure I could say I argue with my wife and it probably was about something related to the kids are the kids in money or something like that we have kid at for kids and integrate kids but but kids are a little expensive at times and then so I don't remember what it was but it was a ballet class or something like that and it wasn't necessarily free I'll put it that way and you know so we can if we had an argument about it because she was just one of those things where you know my wife you know you know you know if she if the kids has an interest and anything related to anything you say let's let's invest all of this in it and it's see what happens after while you like okay fine
 a situation I wish I would have handled differently
 I would probably
 okay that's even the hardest decision I've ever had to make was when I was in the Army and I had to fire someone who has been in the service for 15 years that was pretty tough because this person went out and he had I guess made a bad decision you had a DUI and he had the family and he had people that depended on him and we had to remove them from this position and I was a junior officer at the time and I wasn't charged with with doing the firing so it's kind of weird size you know if someone you go out you have beer with there a drink with than and actually you know you got as far as first so that was hard because you know it's one of those things where are you
 you really wanted things about the military at you you always hear the stories of where you shouldn't I guess been an officer you shouldn't be so involved with your peers are your subordinates and that's what the thing and it's it was true for me because I I was a cool laid-back kind of guy and and when it's time to make decisions like that their tot interpersonal because you you realize that you're affecting someone to livelihood and and that stuff
 tell me about
 yes that's her name of her
 and in general I've been okay you know
 not like
 I've been okay some days are great some days are a crappy but on average there okay now it's not so what I call swing it away
 not lately I do feel
 that
 I do feel that
 the older I get the older I get I'm just more like you know inpatient about certain things you know just get you know you're you know you think that when you're younger or more
 impatient
 it's okay like I can easily is there something I said I better not as I guess I I find that
 I can get a good night's sleep when
 when I go to bed at a certain time if I go to bed too early it's it's not good
 my falculty these are not old all their I need more to become engaged throughout my day and I'm easily distracted
 I have not
 I have not
 I felt really happy I can say last weekend although I did have some down on me but I took my is my wedding anniversary and I took the wife and kids went to Disneyland and I guess it is a happiest place on Earth whatever but really young age where everything is you know you know everything is fun for them so that that makes me happy
 my mom is been a positive influence in my life I did mention a group in Alabama group in a single-family household and she's always been encouraging and I think when they're so much discouragement around in many different package
 they have someone that supportive it's always great you know it's always good to have that in your corner because you you going to get it you going to get rejection enough so but to have someone support you and your decisions is always good
 I think my best friend would probably say that
 I'm a hard worker have a strong work ethic that I'm generally someone who is responsible and easy-going kind of guy well-liked guy
 something you did
 what I'm most proud of I can say that that that makes me happy you know because it's something I think that you're under appreciated sometimes but the
 I like when my kids now my oldest kid you know wants to show me something you worked on it's cool I mean I think that's great and he's eight and then it's just great and it's good because one day he's going to grow up and he's going to have a kid of his owner of a family of his own and so you know I I think the best thing I can do is give him that example of what it's like to be a dad and to be responsible that's something I never I never had I never saw so I'm kind of it's not like I have a textbook to go back in reference or anything but I think you know it makes me proud because you have little Minds that you're shaping you know a little people that that see what you're doing and and and that kind of want to be like you so that's kind of cool
 you're welcome
 goodbye
 okay
