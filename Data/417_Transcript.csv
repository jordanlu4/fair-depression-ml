thank you
 creative
 I'm pleased
 are you okay
 yes
 I'm okay
 a Los Angeles
 I don't know
 kind of dirty but that's to be expected from a big city
 my the last class I need to go to Sociology class I'm not really sure where I'm going with school but I'm thinking about sex education
 how did you do
 I think that is a really important job I feel like
 because there's kind of a
 Stigmata guess about talking about sex at leads to like a lot of unsafe sex more than planned pregnancies so I feel like it's a very important job for
 the world
 I don't know
 okay
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot
 lack of funds
 it depends on the people but I'd say that generally more shy of course of people who I know well like we're closer to me I am more outgoing
 sometimes when I'm feeling
 the best of guy
 play with my dogs
 I don't know if it's a nice day I'll go for a walk if it's not a nice day then or if it's like cold out or something then maybe watch a show on TV I like or read a book or something
 I'd say I'm pretty good at controlling my temper
 I can't remember I think the last person I argue with was my boyfriend probably last week but I don't even remember what it was about
 you feel guilty about
 I don't think I really feel guilty about anything I say that I regret things but I think there's a difference between guilt and regret
 like I think guilt is more just like feeling bad but regret is like feeling like you should have made a different decision and I think that can help you in to make better decisions in the future where is guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless
 I regret not doing better when I was in high school
 I mean not getting better grades I regret
 Blake getting involved with certain people in the past but I mean I'm not sure that's about it that I can think of right now
 you done anything to avoid
 yeah I mean I mean in the past yeah I could have made different decisions I mean obviously some things you know you aren't entirely in your control but I'm not going to feel I'm not going to regret things that I had no power over so
 I'm not sure if I would want to erase it from my memory
 but
 I wish that it didn't happen to me was a time that I was raped
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
 I can't really think of any hard decisions
 I can't think of any
 okay
 tell me about
 I'm not sure I can't think of any
 I have a pretty good relationship with my family not I wouldn't say that I'm really close with my mother but I mean we get along well and I'm very close to my sister we're basically best friends
 I think that my mother has been a positive influence in my life
 because she was always able to provide for me and she always she didn't like mistake sometimes but I think that she was always there for me when I needed it and she just did her best to raise me so I think she was a big positive influence
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 it's been easy lately sometimes I have trouble sleeping but
 lately I have had no problems
 it depends how long I've gone without sleep I can just be anywhere from like groggy to Lake really on edge
 and like
 extremely tired
 I have been feeling pretty good I have like general anxiety kind of all the time but it's not as bad as it has been
 in the past
 so
 I'm feeling mostly pretty good
 I think that I've actually been feeling happier lately
 I want to say that I'm like really happy all the time I mostly just kind of
 like a neutral but I have been feeling more positive lately
 I'm actually not sure if I have been diagnosed with PTSD
 tell me about
 I know that I've been seeing a psychologist for like since I was 16 for depression and I think my first psychologist who I saw for a few years thought that I had PTSD but I'm not sure if she ever made a diagnosis
 did you think you had a problem before you found out
 I'm not sure
 I don't know
 yes
 it's helpful to talk someone and have them kind of
 guide you in talking about something so that you can figure things this figure out your feelings about things sort of I guess for yourself or like why it helps to talk with somebody because you can figure out why you're feeling a certain way about something I mean I think sometimes you can do that on your own but talking to somebody helps I think
 not sure
 I'm not sure
 I'm not sure
 I think I would spend it mostly at home
 but it would be sunny out and I would go outside a little bit and and play with my dogs and
 I probably have my boyfriend over
 I eat food that I like like only through that I like like my favorite foods watch
 movie or TV show that I like just
 kind of have like a relaxing time but that's nice
 I would tell myself to
 to to do better in school because throat High School is kind of an underachiever and I ended up going to Community College like on and off because I would like to have lose interest and then not do well or as well as I could have so I would tell myself to do as well as I could in school because I feel like I am capable of a lot more than I do and I think I could easily have gone missing a scholarship if I have done well in high school so I just tell myself to do good in school and probably wore myself about one or two people that turned out to be not worth my time
 I think I am proud of myself for not being bitter and for wanting to live kind of bitter and yes but I guess I'm proud of myself for not being selfish and wanting to make the world a better place like cuz a lot of bad things have happened to me and I tried to instead instead of dwell on them I try to or I want to be able to make things better for other people and as much as I want to help I guess Empower people to make their lives better
