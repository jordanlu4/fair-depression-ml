 I thought

 I know it's a she look real.
 Also just talk to her about everything
 okay
 okay
 baked chicken
 hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today
 created to talk to people and say
 I'm not a therapist
 and please feel
 are you okay with this
 flying today today is my daughter's birthday
 that's great
 California
 yes
 the beach
 I love the waters
 the game violence
 violence
 can you tell me about
 I lost a lot of friends going up in through Elementary and high school just losing them through gang violence
 I'm sorry to hear that
 yeah thank you
 best free Papa Bear
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot
 haven't been to any place out of California yet so not really
 optician I'm a certified optician and I also have my associate's degree
 how did you do
 actually I women I didn't really know what I wanted to do when I first applied I just want to change my life and do something successful before I settle down and I have my daughter and everything actually my guidance counselor kind of help me and I I always thought like they were so cool cuz they're white Long Lap
 what's your dream job
 Sylvia optometrist
 unto them are you not touching and that's like the first step and why is it the question is because then I would have a beer with have my own business and I'll have something successful to leave so my daughter and she wouldn't have to really want for anything it will be like a family business but I'll tell the community as well and something I can leave for my daughter
 my daughter she's five years old should we start an elementary school next week and today is her birthday or five years ago I had her
 very smart I taught her home I homeschooled her for 5 years and she's adorable she's my heart
 do you find it easy to be a parent know this is like the hardest job ever is very hot
 providing providing making sure that you washed your clothes because I miss hard enough to be a parent but I'm a young parent and I'm a little more mature than her father so
 it's fine if it's the providing part I will basically say making sure that you have everything that they need is so complicated I let alone and gives you a busy ass home to be more to go the extra mile leaving being here today I probably would have still been in bed but his party and I was trying to make whatever extra little money I can make you know to make sure that you have a good day so it's all about going to extra mile. Anything that you can do it up her to provide for their but it's a very hard job
 that moment when your child tells you how much they care about you and my daughter her favorite things to tell me about I'm her heart you know it I want to eat you make a call your name ages it's a sense of reality to be called Mama Ritz-Carlton call Dad and it is like it if I swear she also let you know that this is really I love you this is my life this is what I'm living right now and
 if a if I have a very good feeling that's the best part of being a parent
 thank you
 a lot of different things I'm actually taking care of my daughter
 I'm here with her I was raised by my grandparents so I mean I didn't really get to know my mom since I was 16 and
 my father I mean I couldn't Point them out or the street or sidewalk so I don't know who he is I feel that I'm very different from them because no matter how hard the job is getting I don't give up
 there's boob there's been a lot of different people that have been very positive in my life I can say my sister she was a good influence on me to get into the medical field she's in a lot of she's an LVN and she's one of my older sisters
 I can say
 me believing in God
 being in my life God being in my life has also kept me strong enough to know that I don't have to take on This World by myself because God is there for me and
 I don't know
 I don't really like them to a lot of different people because
 people are hateful
 that's the most random thing that's in positive for me
 are Liam outgoing I used to be shy coming up as a kid and I don't know I don't know what happened to me one day as it's broke out of my shell and I've been
 very accurate of showing my personality off
 not Hawaii but it's the best I've got
 what do you do to relax
 I actually like four
 the waves to collapse against the rocks at the beach and I like to just sit there
 and the Zone everybody else out there
 and rub my toes in the sand and that is so relaxing
 how are you at controlling
 give me some of that
 I learned not to cuz it's a form of it's a form of knowing who's in control and is it your life for the someone else is and I feel that my temper me controlling my temper
 are you showing it I'm in charge of my life so I don't even let stuff get to me I don't even really remember the last time do I have to control back somebody because that's how much I try to block out the negativity
 probably
 fire daughter's father you know the dishes are physical altercation like what
 okay
 what's something you feel guilty about
 wow
 I kind of feel guilty about helping like a recipe how things ended before my mom passed I wish that
 I could have helped her a little more even though it people tell me not to feel bad because she was really there for me growing up but I kind of feel guilty like you know not being there as much as I could have been for her before she passed away so I think that's something that I still feel guilty for
 okay
 tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
 going through my mom passing away
 I felt like I felt like
 basically that
 it was so kind of
 Robinson's like I fell everyone else have parents and I grew up with my grandparents and then I'm going to go so many years without actually going to Mom and Dad for me to get 18 years old and then then she leaves me it was kind of like
 I don't know it was nerve-racking because
 I felt robbed in Oleg I didn't have her all these years and then now that I'm older and I don't even have right now
 so
 ever had
 find me the paper of having a c-section when it was time for me to have my daughter I was so nervous so scared I really didn't know what to do I have to take it I mean like
 that was so scared
 I know the safest way of bringing my daughter into this world
 are you happy
 yes
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep
 card I didn't even sleep last night that's why I'm yawning but
 I kind of tend to
 how to do everything and I have to get back to the stage word
 I have to think about myself as well
 can buy soap on
 what are you like when you don't sleep well
 a little like this but actually a little nicer today
 groggy
 okay
 lately I've been feeling very confident about being positive about going the extra mile of being a good parent
 have you noticed any changes in her behavior
 I actually really don't care what other people think anymore I used to let that bother me and I don't know more
 no
 also happy that my daughter is this world today on her birthday
 Guinness no people
 is there anything you regret
 laughing moment
 what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago
 watch who I associate with
 what are some things you wish you could change about yourself
 my way
 tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly
 also my grandma
 can you tell me if
 okay
 my daughter
 my pride and joy
 wow thank you bye
 this is cool I need to take her home
 but they say they're okay
