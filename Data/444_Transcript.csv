yes
I'm doing very well today I feel good today
 Borden Indiana grew up in Bloomington
 I moved to LA for a job working with the CDC
 I've only been back twice in the past 20 years
 my family is not there anymore I went back for high school reunions
 it's much Greener it's very green a very small
 very young
 wooded areas before I played in the woods when I was a kid we summon the corries I rode my bicycle everywhere and here it's a little more cement in traffic
 it was it just seemed like cement at first but I loved it now and I have friends and I love being able to do so many different things and I go to the beach a lot I took up to the mountains I go camping all the time so I I love it I love it always opportunities
 I have traveled quite a bit I was in the Peace Corps and I was in South America is in Paraguay for 3 years and I traveled all three South America Brazil Peru Chile Bolivia on a suspended year in London travel through Europe and I used to go to Canada often I'd love to get to Asia one of these days
 meeting new people at the food I love trying new food in just getting a different perspective on the world and different people's outlook on the world
 and because America tends to become isolated
 I hike the Inca Trail when I was in Peru that was a 5 Day hike starting out of Cusco we hiked for 45 days and woke up went the last morning at the sun gate of Machu Picchu and that was just in the most amazing experience cuz I don't need I'd seen about seen it in National Geographic you know all my life so to be there and experience that was phenomenal
 awesome
 philosophy of mint green philosophy I minored in art and business and I got very disenchanted with it very quickly and so I decided to study what I wanted to study while I was in college and had the opportunity so that's what I wanted to do and everyone advised me against it because you can't get a job as a philosopher that I had the idea of getting My Philosophy degree then going to law school and being a professor of Ethics but that kind of fell apart and that's actually how I ended up joining the Peace Corps so it all worked out
 I'm sorry
 yeah
 I'm sorry my alarms going off on my phone it'll die in a second okay inside still going
 sorry I turned off the phone but I forgot to turn off the alarm
 Mexico
 okay I'm sorry what was the question
 my dream job gosh
 writing I've done a few scripts and screenplays with a friend of mine but I don't really want to do it the Hollywood thing but writing in teaching
 and traveling if I could do that overseas
 are going
 turn turn off my alarm
 I can't move okay I can't get to my first okay I'm sorry yes
 I forgot it's time to go to yoga class
 I'm terribly sorry about that
 sorry for the interruption
 I have an actual fish tank at my house tonight I do the same thing and I do that with my children when they get upset that I put them in front of a spanking is very relaxing I also try to meditate I try and and just sit down and be quiet and gather my thoughts I'd like to read and are sometimes I walk I'll take my dog for a walk
 I wish I could say I was good at it but usually I I tend to have outbursts every once in awhile when things are getting too chaotic at my house and I am feeling very underappreciated I will have a burst of anger
 yeah my husband doesn't appreciate that and I've never done it at work or in a social situation but at home with my family I've done it and then instead of recognizing that I'm sad about it my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad and then that escalates and sometimes I just end up walking out the door
 or going to my room
 I'm sorry
 I usually after I have an outburst and I isolate myself for a little bit I can come back relaxed and deal with the situation in a more calm manner
 I'm sometimes it's very hard. I've gotten to the point where I know just to stop in and get myself out of there and then go take some deep breaths and then really try and figure out what I'm feeling why I'm being angry why why am I being so tense
 and then be able to verbalize that
 well it happens a few times when I start getting it had a very tense day and things haven't gone right I tend to have Outburst in the kitchen while I'm making dinner and the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework or they're turning on the TV or and my husband's are bothering me about things that I just don't need to think about right then and one time I just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone get out just let me finish dinner and nobody would and I just it just had more pressure building up in building up and actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove really hard just like get people to pay attention to what I was saying and actually made a dent in my stove which is still there so that's that I should have
 walked out sooner and taking my deep breaths before I did that
 it was probably when I was pregnant with my first child
 I wasn't married
 I had a very good friends so I was I was 32 at the time so I was you know it wasn't young I think if I was younger I probably would have decided to have an abortion but at that point in my life I'm like okay I'm going to have this child
 and I had got pregnant by the man I actually married and still married to but we'd only been dating like 3 months and I was living with a good friend of mine who had been in the Peace Corps with and she in so I didn't know this guy very well I didn't know if we could raise a child together I didn't know if I wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else and my friend suggested that we raise the child together even suggested moving to Costa Rica to raise the child together and so I was a lot of
 huge decisions that we're going to determine the rest of my life
 and I made the decision based on
 more common sense and practicality
 but I don't regret that decision I think I made a good decision
 to marry my husband and raise our child
 and they're older now my my oldest is 17 he is at DaVinci Science school and he's very much into engineering he is getting his pilot's license which I'm very proud of them for the my daughter is 15 and she loves acting she she has a boyfriend who they see just once a week at church basically and they text each other constantly she's a very very typical 15 year old and then I had a 12 year old he is extremely active and is in constant motion and always making noises but I love him dearly he is into rock climbing and there's a rock climbing gym near our house so he has a membership there so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis
 no I find it extremely difficult I wasn't my mother had a varied if my dad died when I was young and my mother kind of disconnected when that happened so I didn't have a very warm or loving relationship with my mother or growing up and I basically raised myself I was kind of on my own from a very young age I mean she was at the house but really had no interaction with her so I really didn't have parenting skills that you know most people are are raised with I know what not to do but sometimes it's very difficult and I see my friends that has you know these
 very innate parenting skills is very warm and you know they're making cookies and everything's organic and they know everything and know their house is always perfect and it's like I'm just not that person so I I I Tried & B I think I am a very good mother but I'm not a typical mother I think I'm more and more creative a lot of times and we do a lot of things but it's not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing
 actually when we go camping it's more I'm more homey when I go camping then I am at home I think I'm more tense when I'm at home
 but I'm trying to factory meditation and things if that's what I'm trying to become
 calmer and more patient I think my patience is what I need to work on the most
 and they've been an insomniac all my life I remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and I haven't slept well for a long time but I realize that if I exercise and I do something with my brain intellectually during the day I have to be physically tired and intellectually tired to sleep well and that's sometimes that's hard to do and so loud house I stayed stay awake beating I'll read till midnight and then I'll try and go to sleep and usually I don't get back up even if I wake up at 3 again and things of that sort. I'll try to go back to sleep
 yesterday I didn't feel so good I was I think a lot of it has to depend on the weather and was all cloudy and gray yesterday cuz I plan to when you're done working in my garden and then I'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard so I had some more planting to do and I just cooked in kind of feel like doing it so hard to put out about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but today I feel really good
 I feel more positive I feel more energy
 I don't know I just got a new mattress actually that hasn't really help me sleep but it was really good because I've needed one for a really long time and I was just kind of excited about being to get delivered in and set up and in that sounds like so mundane but it was you know just like I'm finally doing something positive cuz it's it's something that I put off doing and put off doing put off doing and it was like finally there in concrete and it's like I've done this task that I can check off my list but also I took the kids camping over on spring break and we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and around the campfire and making some more as and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy
 I don't know I think she believes that I'm
 more intellectual and smarter than I think that I am at times so she comes to me with a lot of issues she always she always listen to advice remains she thinks I give her good advice and when she doesn't know what to do so I shall ask me and then sometimes she just calls me to run things by just like to complain about because I'm sympathetic or empathetic and I just I'm just there to listen and I don't need to give her any advice so I think it's a good listener in
 I procrastinate a lot
 I start projects and I don't finish them so that's what I'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that I started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and I'm very enthusiastic about them when I when I start them and I'll get almost finished and then I don't know what happens I just completely lose interest sometimes I think it's because I'm afraid to finish them which sounds a little strange but
 I'm working on that
 to get this done
 oh gosh
 not following through on the opportunities I had when I got out of the Peace Corps there was a lot of things that I could go and try to go on to get my Master's Degree what are the grants and things so that's where it but instead I got pregnant got married and I had a wonderful job that I really liked and really enjoyed but then when I got pregnant the second time is right at a time where I had to fight for a directorship and I realized my limitations where I I couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything I needed to do to get a directorship and so I really wish so I resigned and I wish I had stuck with that cuz then I would have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding in
 solid career
 not base decisions on emotions sometimes I am and not I have some really bad bosses the jobs were wonderful but my ego got in the way
 and I would have told myself to let go of that aspect of the job that goes the the egotistical reactions that I had to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well
 my children actually and also my Peace Corps experience was just phenomenal and people are actually really interesting that they were like an all that they actually know someone who actually did that so that that's why I always when I was a little girl my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the Peace Corps when it first started and I always said I want to do that one day I want to do that one day I want to do that one day and I finally got to the point where I don't have to shut up or do it so that's
 that was one of my powdered experiences
 okay
 thank you
