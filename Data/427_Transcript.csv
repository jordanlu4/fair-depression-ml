and then I'm going to go ahead and
 how long do I talk to her more
 okay
 okay
 yeah sure
 I'm good how are you
 I'm from Florida originally
 where you from for work
 I haven't been back in like a few months
 I don't know I guess it's like a smaller town than here
 it was pretty easy so it's not that much of a difference except my guess what buildings are bigger
 I like the weather and I like the environment of like
 Hollywood I guess
 I hate the transportation transportation system and the traffic is really bad
 yeah I traveled a lot around America
 I like like seeing new places and meeting new people from different areas and stuff and I guess it's just relaxing and it's fun
 I went to Canada once my mom has a friend up there so we went to visit her there it's pretty cold I didn't like that
 about that particular trip or
 I don't know if she meet us this like Canadian food cause I think it's poutine or something and so I guess that means I was a new experience
 I tried to get out in the sun like go to the beach or something
 I read a book
 I'm pretty okay
 depends on how bad the situation is
 I don't know like two days ago I was arguing with my sister about something
 oh yeah I really don't remember it was something stupid I think she
 she borrowed something from me and she didn't give it back on time
 I don't know I guess maybe I wish I'd just wouldn't lose my temper so quickly sometimes
 but that doesn't happen really often
 I don't know I guess think more before I talk and maybe I won't lose my temper
 I wish I could erase your memory
 I don't know I guess just
 like God negative people or something or negative people that I've met before I guess I just want to race the thought of meeting him
 well I have like friends that we're just like not very good company and they're just very not very good influences so yeah I would just want to erase me even when I'm not friends with him anymore
 my
 is it possible for my family so I wasn't
 and my friends now
 oh it's pretty good I talk to them like I see them a lot
 so
 hardest decision I've had to make
 I don't know
 I guess
 what I wanted to study in college Maybe
 it's not that hard but it's a little it's a big decision
 computer science
 yeah a little bit not not as much but a little bit
 well I got into it it when I got into it when I was a teenager so I guess I just and I was going to it so I just figured I'd go on studying it hired at a higher level
 yeah somewhat but I kind of wanted to be kind of try to make a decision between. And like the Arts so yeah I'm stopping you did it though
 dream job fashion designer
 how hard is the job
 I don't think it's a hard job I like clothes and fabric and making fools like that so I don't think it's a hard job actually
 I fall asleep like within 5 minutes depending on how tired I am
 I'm very irritable and yeah I'm very irritable in
 not good to be around when I'm tired
 and I can't focus
 I've been feeling good Vine
 thanks
 no
 no
 no
 the last time I felt really happy
 I guess like a week or so ago I went to
 I went to
 running now I went to this event downtown it was like a art walk thing so it was exciting
 thanks
 I was just like different art galleries and stuff downtown you're just exhibiting there working I don't know it's just interesting to walk around and see all that
 I think I am
 generous
 patient
 I think
 I'm a good friend
 I think I'm hard-working
 and what else
 I wish I was more outgoing like more sociable person and
 I don't know when and I wish I was like I guess not
 not easy to anger like temper something
 oh no not in trouble It's just sometimes it's not pleasant for people getting on a temper I've never gotten in trouble for
 really badly
 I can't think of it I guess I was in
 I was in a elevator one time and this person was running towards it and like I was trying to hold it for them but I couldn't reach it in time they like stop cursing me out so like I felt really bad because they probably thought I didn't try to open it for them but yeah
 it was
 infab credit not really I want ya I regret
 not contacting like old friends they knew
 so I guess maybe I'll do that in the future
 I know them from like Elementary School
 yeah but we lost contact for the years
 cuz I switch schools
 for now
 I don't know I guess I would just say
 learn as much as I can and I don't know just don't hold back so much with my gum
 like not being outgoing and stuff I guess I just told myself to be more outgoing
 I think they say the same thing I said earlier that I'm generous
 patient hard-working and
 call Stacy
 kind I hope they say that
 I am proud of my intelligence
