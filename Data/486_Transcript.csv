 I've been here a couple times I just recently moved back 2 months ago
 St Louis is quite slower

 thank you
 I jumped right back on the bandwagon
 things you really like it
 the climates
 the restaurants
 the dirt and the traffic
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes
 yes I do
 the road maps following a road map may be driving myself
 but we just recently got back from Colorado
 what happened to the mountains so that the snow and enjoy the little fine dining
 in Colorado
 I actually going horseback riding through the Royal Gorge
 yes it was
 I would be more outgoing
 I'm a people person
 I listen to jazz music and I also draw
 I've probably mastered controlling my temper through age
 it would have been my husband and it was about financial issues
 and ensure unstable I don't like loud talking or loud emotion I like to sit in methodically and logically talk about things not raise my voice
 most recently with the illness of my friend I wish I would have handled his sister a little differently as far as things that she's wanted me to do that I really needed to tell her
 otherwise
 the way they really needed to be done I took her advice where I shouldn't have
 how do you know that
 we I was engaged to him 15 years ago and he recently called me I guess about five years ago and told me he was diagnosed with cancer we've always maintained our friendship and I asked my husband if I could go help him in this time of need and I'm here
 it has been
 a lot of things one he's a good friend of mine and his sister moved out here as well to my son wanted to start his career out here 3 I love the weather
 and that's all I can think of at the moment
 I would be the the death of my youngest son
 can you tell me about that I don't know where to start as far as he was born premature and since he was born so early I had him in 5 months versus 9 the we we made the decision to take him off life support cuz he wasn't getting any better so that would have been the the hardest decision I made with my husband
 I really don't want to erase anything from my memory
 I've actually learn and experience and gain knowledge from from things that happen so I'm not I'm not one to put things erase things out of my mind I categorize them
 and play some in memories
 that's very close lost my mother at a young age and Ava siblings and my father still remain very close
 my father
 always very health-conscious very energetic and exercises and has a spirituality about him that I want to have as well the contentment that he that he portrays that I that I would like to have as well
 how is your day
 no problem
 very confused or skittish I guess would be the word
 lately fine except for the fact that my good friend who I'm helping take care of we just got out of the hospital so it's been a little hectic the last 2 days
