 I'm okay
 I was born in Mississippi
 when I was 2 and 1/2 years old but actually wasn't me all day was kind of Monica
 yes
 never
 I was only two and a half years old I don't remember everything
 things you really like about Olay
 oh I like the beach I love all the restaurants the music thing just a general excitement in the Parks and all that
 the traffic do maintenance on the streets all the potholes
 the pollution
 well I study a number of things at school I studied
 at one point I was I I had major in public relations journalism specialization journalism then I also studied as a pre-law major and so I studied the law and then I also studied human and Human Services courses
 mainly because I'm a people person and I enjoy helping people
 that's great
 what's your dream job
 wow dream job
 my dream job
 I don't really have one right now
 okay
 I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer
 do you travel a lot
 no I don't and I can't even see your shoes
 sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver
 what do you do
 listen to music watch horror movies I love horror flicks and I have a fish tank tooth I like to watch my fish also like to play tennis when I can I haven't been able to play Lately though because of physical problems
 can you tell me about that
 it's just that I had injury drum mic my my ankle because I have anemia and and I got dizzy one night and I fell on my ankle and on my leg and so I'm just waiting for that to really heal but I'm planning on getting back into town this is one of the things I enjoy doing it really relaxes me
 I really don't have a temper over the years I've learned how to do how to control that
 probably would have been yesterday but there was no argument and what was it about
 nothing that I can recall
 what's something you feel guilty about
 something I feel guilty about
 there's nothing right now that I feel guilty about
 a situation that I wish I had handled differently
 I really can't think of one right now
 the hardest decision
 be absolutely hardest decision that I ever had to make was when my I have twins twin twin boys are grown now I had twins twin teen teenagers and I had lost my job and we were living in a motel and the rent for the motel was outrageous I couldn't no longer continue to pay the cable the type of money that they wanted so I had to briefly put my son under the and in foster care for 4 for a minute that was the hardest decision I had to make
 schizophrenic and he had had he was born with auditory processing deficit which he overcame through training for a speech therapist and and school officials and he also this is he also lost his hair when he was 4 years old but
 and then we turned 14 to schizophrenia came up so right now he he's going to supportive living environment is 27 years old he's come to terms with his mental illness and he accepts it now that I had problems in the past because he didn't want to take the medication to give him the medication and he hide it and stick it in his pocket or whatever so but he's come to terms with that and we will all have come to terms with that he's doing he's doing pretty good
 that son he's 27 to Texas with his wife and he got a promotion to
 so now he's in California to buffering California okay so that's a very good about that yeah
 well I've grown children are grown children
 not it's not hard to be a parent of grown of my grown children okay when they were younger it was difficult times okay difficult. And is this a good time to but yeah there's some difficult times
 well the difficult times I really pretty much already alluded to Matt was when one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenia can and they were in temporarily and when was in foster care and one was actually in an institution because of the schizophrenia so
 and I lost track of the question
 the hardest thing about being a parent at this point this point in my life there is nothing hard about it
 what's the best thing about being a parent
 the best thing about being a parent I don't know I guess it's just to see something that you created and developed into a pretty decent human being you know a person
 smsa
 oh a lot of ways well actually I didn't have two parents I had a mother and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so I have no contact with him but the things that I do
 differently than what my mother did she was a strong disciplinarian both verbally and physically
 and she had the tendency to see how group has tendency to be very critical critical and
 opinionated and very religious
 and swearing
 for a look at people who were not that was me as if they were living life wrong because they were not going to church and reading the Bible and all that kind of thing
 was that the park
 the question
 I don't get a good night sleep I don't sleep at all unless I take medication and that's that that's all there is to it I don't take medication I don't sleep I'll be up all night I will be up for days if I don't take medication
 irritable
 I'm tired
 well
 lately
 you know just a little anxious really you know I just recently made a move to a new apartment has a lot of expenses and new experiences and things like that and I will new furniture and leave this and that that you have to get a managed to do all that but the whole thing was kind of stressful
 POF
 no not PTSD
 we are
 that was back in I think 2004
 because my life has gotten so stressful to the point where it was either I had to do something or or in something to tell you the truth
 yes
 yeah I think it's useful you know what's a good sounding board you know someone to throw you know your concerns out and we'll discuss things that may be bothering you are good things to eat with medication
 cuz I've been going to therapy the changes a lot of changes I've been more focused
 more
 hopeful
 it is just been a good experience for me which is why I've been saying to go
 really happy
 well I can feel really happy by some currents I can't think of anything right now just like that and then I go back to how I was feeling so I can't really pinpoint anything really I mean
 I mean something comes to me unexpectedly or things go right for a change and continue to go right as opposed to things going wrong all the time
 that makes me happy when things go right how about that
 something I did recently
 but I really
 can I live with somebody that I really enjoyed being really really enjoyed
 recently
 I can't think of anything
 I don't have a best friend
 my best qualities or that
 I'm an honest person
 I genuinely give people the benefit of the doubt everyone in my book
 is as they appear to be until they prove prove it differently very generous overly generous
 and I'm very I like to help other people I mean help them come on a personal level and help people problem is it gives me pleasure to do something for somebody that's helping their mouth
 anything I regret
 how so
 it's only one thing I regret and that is sad
 after my twins that became old enough to start going to school at the elementary school level
 I was taking some courses as a pre-law major and
 at the time I was married to their father turned out not to be a good
 fit for me and
 because of the stresses involved with him
 well knowing that that was running and I was going to leave him I dropped out of college
 that was my biggest regret
 stay in school no matter what stay the course no matter what
 but I'm a good person
 I'm a good human being
 fo
 okay
 goodbye
 that's going to go go by are you done
 okay
 I was weird
 I was a little weird I was a little nervous
