 okay thank you thank you
 yes
 okay
 Los Angeles
 the weather
 the variety of environments the ocean you know various different environment or environmental variety
 I don't like the superficiality of people the narcissistic attitude
 just the
 it doesn't have a small-town sort of feel where you know just the warm the human sort of warms the interactively so yeah
 no
 am I have a fear of flying and I have developed agoraphobia
 incredibly difficult
 I'm guessing you mean the agoraphobia more so than the fear of flying it's it's more of a recent development and
 it's it's pregret it's progressing to be worse it's very what's the word immobilizing and very distressing actually
 yes it is
 how do I cope with that
 just
 just trying to do the best I can and try to you know have the most courage I can in the situation and challenge myself and small steps I read a lot I do I'm bibliotherapy reading and I try to inform myself of the of the professional literature I'm so that I could hopefully over comment someday
 yes definitely
 certain things trigger at like enclosed spaces being in a car traveling being away from home being in someone else's car things that are outside of my locus of control
 add actually I don't go to school right now
 my dream job is
 to be a psychologist
 I'm not a psychologist but what would make me decide to do that is
 having lived through some challenges like this having lived through some traumas but I've always had an interest in it since junior high of I'm very interested in people and Men human interaction and human connection and the betterment of of of those things bridging people together and helping people interpersonally through their child personal challenges so that's that's sort of in a nutshell
 I think I'm someone who's
 I can be very outgoing and sort of a warm and friendly presents very easily but I think on the exterior but I think I'm shy and I challenged it to do that
 I think it hard I'm shy but I but I challenge myself completely cuz I do love human interaction so I take those risks and and jump and those challenges
 the last time I interacted with somebody was today
 if I think I'm understanding your question correctly
 oh no I think I misunderstand your question but I I interacted with Rachel I just I'm continuously interacting with people
 take taking those risks
 a very good
 very good
 I just left them argued with somebody
 actually can't remember it wasn't recent
 I have to think about that I don't know yet let me think
 I'm drawing a blank I can only remember things
 from what I was like 21 right now I can't think of anything contemporary right right now my mind is
 okay I when I was younger
 can you tell me about that yes I lost a relationship with my aunt and my uncle and my cousin's cuz when I was 21 on 45 I
 I had a disagreement with my aunt and I said something that was a critical of her and she threw me out of their home and
 let me back I apologized immediately and they let me back into their lives and change their minds so
 I regret that
 I'm assuming you mean how do I feel when they asked me to never I'll be in their lives again and to leave shattered Soul shattered heart shattered
 tell me about
 well that that was my family that was the good side of my family there's
 the majority of my fat they were they were the the loving aspect of my family on the rest of my family is very cruel and very abusive
 I'm I don't have any relationship with my family at all like there since I was 21 since my aunt and uncle
 disown me I guess it's the right word estranged yeah
 gosh I'm drawing a blank just bear with me for one second something I could erase
 I can't even get it to my memory
 as an example
 I was injured and I wish I could get that away from my memory
 yeah I was injured in the emergency room
 doing I went in for food poisoning I was ordered to go in by a doctor I had collapsed and I was ordered to go into the ER for that I said food poisoning and I came out injured with a neurological syndrome I was injured with a
 what do you call it
 intravenous procedure and now I have RSD reflex sympathetic dystrophy and the scene in the emergency room was it was an out-of-control saying there was a problem with the procedure and the doctor was yelling at his staff who made a mistake and it was extremely excruciating it was a crisis and so every time I think about the injury and it was disfigured I got disabled got disabled for disabled permanently from it was also a disabled from my employment for a quite amount of a given amount of time as well and and it I have residual physical Trauma from it and disfigurement and
 severe disability disability limited functionality with my right my I'm right-handed my right hand and arm thank you
 tell me about the hardest decisions
 I don't even know what that is
 you know I I really I apologize cuz I can't really probably give you the most suitable answer
 I'm guessing it has something to do with my cat and her her urgent
 what do you call it
 I heard she was in intensive care veterinary care and I'm sure it had something to do with that
 but other than that I would say I had Choosing My Life Path weather
 and I was admitted to that program or whether I was going to go to art school for four years and I had to pick a life Direction but that's not a traumatic situation
 so I don't know how best to answer your question
 I can't
 I have severe nightmares and I have nocturnal panic attacks
 are you triggered by something and I also have physical illness on top of it and I'm in excruciating pain
 you have disturbing thoughts
 yes
 yes
 yes they're triggered by the injury that I told you they're triggered by my family
 how they've treated me what they said to me what they've done to me they're triggered by what else my my physical illness not my injury Olney but my physical illness as well so yes
 I feel very ill
 and feel so fatigued
 very ill and very fatigued
 when I don't sleep and get enough sleep at my anxiety level I believe is up and I'm susceptible to feeling distressed so yeah
 yes
 3 years ago my most recent diagnosis and in 2001 as well
 oh yes
 3 years ago and
 when I was
 20 years old
 the my background my childhood from my family of origin and there are the abuse that I went through and their ultimate what's the word
 rejection of me and estrangement that was the first reason
 no I stopped 6 months ago
 why did I stop I'm just taking a break I'm going to continue
 yes very much
 it's helped tremendously
 I think it helps with anxiety at helps with
 it helps Inspire crate inspiration that helps feeling connected it helps to create what I ultimately my goal is to give myself a voice and it helps to to side is part of that process it also helps to understand myself to learn about myself
 and there's just so many benefits it's
 I'll stop right there and there's many more
 the last time I felt really happy is it was a really long time ago it was before my illness and it was in 1997 on the outside of my illness was in July of 97 so it was before that
 yes I was in a very good place in terms of my career in terms of my just my relationships and everything was just sort of at its best career relationships personal fulfillment start of as well I was very active and and doing a very many things that were made in full to build a life thumb and I was in the process of
 just in the in the planning stages of my life but also very accomplished at the same time so it's just that they were just going very well and I was just really liked just where my life was at it was just in a really good place and many ways
 I wish I could change about myself my anxiety I wish I could change about myself my agoraphobia my PTSD meeting my trauma and what else
 my insecurities as far as just
 with other people in the sense that I'm always trying to make sure that that I don't do something that that hold on one second I'm just trying to make sure that I don't do anything that's offensive to them or insults them or is disrespectful and I I feel like I'm overly cautious about that and it kind of becomes an anxiety unto itself so I I definitely think that would be beneficial to change the other thing I'd like to change about myself and I wish I could feel and also depression I'd like to change about myself I wish I could feel better I wish I didn't feel so tired of the burden that I do love my family I'm not having one
 and what else I wish I didn't have my illness and the physical excruciating pain that I'm in so those are some things and I also wish that and this is a byproduct of PTSD I wish that I didn't have the the symptom ology of PTI say is that definitely affects one's complete complete life like her life completely and I wish I was more articulate and I wish I was someone who was well-spoken and someone was well-written but there's many there's many more things that I wish I could change about myself to improve myself so many more
 I'm not sure
 maybe to not be so trusting I trusted
 I trusted some medical professionals that
 you know again created the injury and it a word
 there's a what's the word there's an expectation and it sort of a demand to just blindly trust the medical profession and don't ask questions or just sort of you know and if not to trust your own self your own your own instincts or intuition and so I would I would have told myself to be a little more careful I guess if that's useful to your question
 what did I really enjoy
 and I can't think of anything specific
 but
 I know it would have to do
 with either reading or connecting with someone on a meaningful level
 I'm most proud of
 my compassion
 my my empathy and caring about people despite I mean I'm proud of it anyways but I'm also particularly am I come from an environment that's the opposite on the background and then the wasn't taught that but I really do care about people and
 I'm I guess I'm most proud of that I'm also proud of my career accomplishments and my tenacity my my Fierce tenacity to succeed and
 you know just also to get the strength it takes to get through the injury to live with it and to live with the illness that I live at the physical illness so I think that would be it
 yes
 okay
 you're welcome
 bye
 okay I've been crying and opening up to this person so I think I did but what you're what you wanted right I'm embarrassed cuz I got really sort of involved like she was asking questions that you know we're really at the heart of you know some of your pay and you know and I was honest about it so the video is like oh my God she don't like this person like that I'm sure this is what you were hoping that someone genuinely interact right with someone okay cool
 okay okay oh thank you yeah I didn't know I'd
