 she said say
 Okay okay so just wait for her to ask question just answer okay
 okay
 thank you
 okay
 yes I am
 something good
 I'm originally from Orange County California
 and now I live in Los Angeles
 I went to college here so I enjoy the fact that a lot of my friends are still around so just ability to see them and be able to hang out with them is really good obviously the weather has been amazing all the time so those are a few things I like about la
 right
 obviously traffic
 and I don't know I think traffic is the main reason and aside from that I don't have much to complain
 all my used to for my old job but not anymore so I'm pretty much based in La most of the time
 I'm just a bility to see other things and explore new things whether it be going to a new site seeing area or trying different kinds of food just the fact that I'm in Conjuring something else or something you is something I enjoy about traveling
 and obviously the people that I am with when I am going traveling cuz I rarely travel by myself so you know whether I travel with my boyfriend or friends the fact that I have companions that I enjoy spending time with you something I enjoy
 sure I for the 4th of July past weekend or two weekends ago actually went to San Francisco to visit my boyfriend so we actually he was moving from LA to San Francisco so we drove up to the Bay Area saw his family and then stayed with my friend who recently moved into a new apartment in Oakland so we hung out with her spend the day in the city went to the ferry building went to the Fisherman's Wharf and hung out and went shopping so although you was kind of a Bittersweet goodbye cuz we are now I'm now in LA and he's in San Francisco but it was a really fun trip
 from the past trip or just in general
 I studied mathematics and economics
 I am actually I just quit my job last Friday I'm taking some time off before I go back to graduate school
 my dream job
 let me think for a second I think I'm really interested in social commerce and Retail so something that combines my interests and also gives me the ability to spend time with people I love my previous job I was working a lot so I was always constantly working and I didn't really get to see anyone or do anything on my own or as I have a hobby but I don't have a job that would give me the flexibility to pursue what I want to do outside of my professional life
 outgoing
 I don't know what I mean you people or when I just hang out with people in general I'm not
 I'm not shy to speak about my feelings or you ask questions or engage in a conversation initiate a conversation so I don't consider myself shy
 sure my family and I are pretty close there back in Orange County but I've been living apart from them for about a ready for years but I still visit them almost every other weekend we go out to dinner and then I hang up my mom we have our shopping strips and spa days once in awhile so we get to bond so I think I have a pretty close relationship my family most importantly my mom she's like almost like my best friend
 I work in the entertainment industry when I work at a YouTube Production Studio which we make content for YouTube vloggers or whatever you call it so I just kind of go on YouTube and look at my favorite YouTube Vlogs from people it's kind of like a mini reality show so I think it's pretty fun other than that I just kind of go through my old pictures to think about like fun times I've had bruised Apple from my trip to Costa Rica last year at my boyfriend or my trip San Francisco with my friends or just kind of think about like
 good times I've had in the past or also I enjoy like exercising of being in nature so I would go for a hike in Santa Monica or something like that
 I think I'm pretty
 good I've never had a situation when I was out of control or now is
 I was acting like I was in myself I think when I don't know I don't think I've actually never had a situation when I was I wasn't able to control my temper I just kind of stay calm and think about the situation and think about how I'm going to respond to it and try to respond to it wisely
 let me think I I don't I can't really remember the last time I argue just saw on maybe when I argued in my old remain about our friendship kind of so we had a conversation about how both of us are kind of drifting apart from each other but it was more of a conversation than the argument so we were able to run both of us are kind of like getting heated up by the topic but we was just kind of cool down and talk about the situation and talk things through
 oh yeah sure so I remember a few months ago a friend of mine visited from Washington DC and we enter a different friends house in Hollywood so when I was there there was this guy who kind of was very confrontational with me about what I do or what I want to do or my stands on certain topics for example was education and then and he started kind of saying like oh you know you're not secure about the Way You Are by blah blah so I kind of was I kind of got angry at them and I just told him
 like you're not giving me a good first impression and you're what you're saying doesn't make sense and I kind of like was very argumentative with them I wish that I was more common was able to kind of
 pro more on why he thought that way instead of attacking him verbally
 guilty I'm guilty about quitting my job too early I'm going back to graduate school and the fall so I was actually supposed to stay a little later till end of July but hey I wanted to enjoy my time and just be unemployed for a little bit so I ended up quitting my job a little early which is a burden on my boss so that's something I feel guilty about
 tell me about the hardest decision
 sure I can talk about my recent graduate school preparation process I was deciding between Glee which is in the Bay Area and he witches in Boston
 like I mentioned before my boyfriend lives in the Bay Area and then he probably would have a I can be together with him in the same area but I think once I got the acceptance letter I knew that I wanted to go there just right away so I had to decide between being on my boyfriend and being complacent and kind of comfortable in California vs venturing out into different city different state different people different environment and B&B in Massachusetts and I ended up deciding with
 although it's far away from my parents family friends boyfriend but I wanted to explore something else and being a different environment
 I don't know if I have anything I want to completely erase from my memory may be my great grandma passed away when I was in the eighth grade I remember I was in a different room but my grandma passed away in a different room but had I stayed there with her I could have kind of see her passed away but I didn't get to do that cuz I was watching TV and some other room and just hanging out I wish I could erase it from my memory cuz it was kind of a traumatic event in my life
 no I haven't
 I've never served in the military
 I did not
 I have never served
 oh I wouldn't know because I didn't listen to military
 no
 I've never served in the military
 I didn't serve in the military
 I didn't serve in the military
 you know just I quit my job I had a good going away party I'm getting ready for grad school a lot of exciting things ahead so I'm excited and happy
 not really I think I've been a lot more positive than before
 very easy
 I'm grumpy and I eat a lot more and I drink a lot of coffee
 no
 no I have not
 2 months ago when I got my acceptance call from my dream School
 I think first and foremost my mom she's always reminded me of who I am and
 you know why I am on this Earth
 and it sounds kind of philosophical but she's been my Foundation
 they would say energetic kind of intense sometimes outgoing
 yeah
 I enjoyed
 when I went hiking two days ago and
 I want my friend Stephanie it was a two-hour hike it was a lot of fun and I always loved hiking so that was something I really enjoyed recently
 nice
 I'm most proud of the fact that I was able to
 Aquaman Aquaman at myself internal environment I actually came when I was I came here when I was in when I was 13 so the fact that I got to where I am in life despite not having not learning how to speak the language about 10 years ago that is something that I'm very very proud of
 goodbye
 hello Cat takes off
