hi Allie
 I'm not a therapist
 and please feel
 are you okay with this yes
 okay
 so how are you doing today pretty well how about you
 where are you from originally
 play like about ale
 well feel that I don't live in LA I live in Long Beach I like that there's
 activity going on lot and a lot more people but generally I'm a small-town type of person
 what are some things you don't really like a brother
 crime
 overcrowding cost of living
 as much as I can
 which one of your most memorable experiences
 that's really hard to say I had a lot of good experiences in the military lot of good experiences in my marriage different traveling places camping raise children I was all good things
 what you study
 Human Services
 all right now I am disabled and hopefully starting back to school in the fall
 a dream job was to be a chemical dependency counselor
 I just say it depends on the circumstances sometimes I can be quite withdrawn velvetizer iron would really outgoing I guess it just depends on this time
 sometimes I'm in really deep thought or have something going on internally so I don't really say a lot I got more observant at that time then I think there's something that needs to be said I'm not I'm not afraid of saying it
 tell me about your relationship with your family
 I have a really good relationship with my family we all speak on the weekly basis I come from a large family have a lot of brothers and sisters my mother and father still living so I talked to them my mother lives not too far away from your father lives in the back
 I got two older brothers that I talk to on a regular basis and my younger sisters that I talked to lots of nieces and nephews
 sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got
 I listen to classical music
 read something maybe watch a movie that's good that's a good Escape read something go to I'm involved with Alcoholics Anonymous I might go to a meeting that that helps me the interact with others
 how are you at controlling
 I rarely have an outburst it imma call him person my demeanor sometimes tells people otherwise but I'm really calm person that people say that I look mean but I'm not
 when was the last time you argue with someone
 that's really hard to say it's probably
 just a disagreement with how somebody was being treated and I'm really that really bothers me when someone is being mistreated and I don't even really know that it really point it out but I know that's probably what it was about
 the first thing that comes to mind is when my marriage broke up
 I wish I would have just accepted it a lot sooner than I did and moved on with my life but it took what I had been I've been married for over 20 years and I was hard for me to accept to accept the fact that my wife wanted a divorce and I tried to hang in a lot longer than just got myself used and abused so I wish I would have just grabbed that situation and moved on a lot faster
 what's something you feel guilty about
 that's when my wife and I took our granddaughters and I promise to raise them and then see them through their upbringing that I didn't have the opportunity to do that by law that was my fault and I feel I feel guilty about that
 tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
 white goes back to acceptance of accepting my the end of my marriage that was that was the hardest decision was so when I finally just decided that to stop fighting the the
 what was going to happen it and move forward
 tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase her memory
 I wouldn't ask say that probably wouldn't want to erase anything from my memory because I have grown and learned from every experience I've ever had in my life so I wouldn't say that I want to erase anything
 that proved that load of thing that makes me who I am today
 and I like me today
 have you ever served in the military yes I have veteran of the United States Army
 how old are you when you join the military was 19 years old
 financially the idea of having a college money once I was very motivated to go to college having that money to to fund my college education was very
 appetizing and also I felt like I needed a break from academics but I knew I wanted to start it up again at some point but that didn't happen you know life happened I got married and then another. I say I'm still trying to complete a college education now at age 47 so
 almost 30 years ago on by but I'll get it
 yes it's the best of the best experience best thing I've ever done for myself but joining the Army I still paying dividends it it's my living today's helps me pay my bills today my pension that I receive
 taught me a lot I got to got to meet people from all over the country see places that I've never seen before getting a lot of opportunities
 did you ever see combat no I did not
 how easy was it for you
 it's a little of this a bit of a struggle you know when you serve in your car after you get used to being regimented and having a place to be every day and then all of a sudden you're free basically in and you don't don't have that that discipline in your life anymore so it's it's hard to to readjust
 I think it took me a long time longer than I realized
 see I was a security guard I worked in the bakery at a Safeway store
 that I install carpet and floor coverings
 for about 10 years or better
 working retail that's a lot of different jobs
 all right
 how did serving in the military change you
 gave me a lot of self-confidence I was never a very athletic inclined but that's the most physical activity that ever had I develop my body
 develop my mind show that much metal 42. I had that I had got me over a lot of things show me a lot of strength about myself
 that's great
 how do you been feeling lately lately I've been feeling pretty good
 it's been going pretty well I've been very a lot more active than I had been
 I'm searching for an apartment right now moving out of my lips are current living situation that's very exciting just been more active in my daily life
 have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
 I'm just not on the same lines I'm seem to be a little bit happier the depression isn't there it's so
 overwhelmingly still have some bad days but not take my medication and then I go to my counseling and its everything seems to be working out pretty well
 sorry to hear that
 how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep is very difficult I toss and turn I have night sweats probably having nightmares and I don't recall
 I wake up several times
 what are you like
 actually I'm not more overly energetic adrenaline takes over and Ida zip through my day with and then at the end of the day I'm exhausted then that makes it hard to sleep again so it's just too
 just continue with vicious cycle
 so I don't know I don't know what to do about it I do not talk to my doctors later want to put me on too much sleep medication and so I just try to get a good night's sleep and just take as much rest as I can try not to nap during the day hopefully having a better sleep during the night
 yes
 time it's been over 10 years cuz all probably longer than that I don't remember the exact date
 anger
 nightmares
 restlessness
 I don't recall everything that they say that cuz I have a lot of overlapping problems so
 and anxiety
 not that I'm aware of
 I really don't know what to say
 I guess I have to get a
 I talked about it
 I feeling down after I talk to people I get out and I do things going to help somebody else get out of my get out of self and get service to others if I get out of self and it's quite helpful
 that's good
 what got you to seek help
 well what brought me this would have gotten me to seek the help is that was an alcoholic and I was drinking and
 and I wanted to quit drinking and then I had to discover the reasons that I was drinking and now you know I was drinking alcohol as a as self medication for different problems and I had to get away from the alcohol and other substances you know other drugs and once I did that I was able to
 professionals who are more able to differentiate with the alcohol problems from the other problems and
 prescribed the right medications prescribed the right then type the right type of treatment or group therapy individual therapy those things have been quite helpful
 do you still go to therapy now yes I do
 yes I do have group therapy 5 days a week and individual therapy once a week
 do you feel therapy is useful very much so
 I'm able to take my
 old heavy luggage and leave it somewhere not carry it around you know it's like a
 it's like I had this big balloons over my head that still with
 all might
 negative thinking my negative
 situations by negative thoughts everything and every time I'm in therapy or I mean the AA meeting or see a meeting I get to empty that vallone out not carry to carry out such a burden to get leave that luggage that garbage somewhere else and I got to carry it around and have it be a burden on myself so I was quite helpful
 can you tell me about that
 and which may
 I'm just it's just an excellent way of
 getting rid of bad feelings
 Cher
 Matt is depressed a lot more outgoing
 I still have a lot with a long way to go
 I don't my feelings of unworthiness are
 limited they still are there but I do feel better about myself that I like myself better today than I did say 2 years ago
 so there's there's hope
 when was the last
 I can't say it it's kind of fleeting
 I don't know that I ever get it like a really super overjoyed
 everything is always so
